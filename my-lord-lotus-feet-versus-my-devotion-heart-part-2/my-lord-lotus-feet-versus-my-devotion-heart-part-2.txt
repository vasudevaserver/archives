Did You think of me
When I was swimming
In ignorance-sea?
"My child,
Definitely My Mind
Was thinking of you
And My Heart
Was missing you."

For You to tell the world
That I belong to You,
Or for me to tell the world
That You belong to me?

My Lord,
Please tell me frankly
If I am ready for a divine life.
"My child,
Right now if I answer
The question,
I shall say without a shadow
Of doubt
That you are ready.
But if I have to answer
The question
At another time,
Then I may have
A different opinion."
Why, my Lord?
"My child,
The time that elapses
May drag you down
And you may not then be ready
For the spiritual life."

My Lord,
You do not sleep.
You meditate and meditate;
You work and work.
I am Your child.
Will I ever be
As great and as good
As You are?
"My child,
I never thought that you could be
Such a fool!
How can there be any difference
Between Father and child?
Is the child not the creation
Of the Father?
I am conscious of what I have
And what I am.
Unfortunately, you are not.
This is the difference
That forces you to swim
In the seas of inequality
And unworthiness."

Only if you feed
Your God-hunger more."

My Lord,
Every year my earthly years
Advance,
And I lose something precious
From my childlike heart.
Is it because of the advancement
Of the years that I am losing
My divine qualities?
"No, My child,
It is not exactly so.
Your passing years have nothing
To do with it.
But every year, unfortunately,
You are over-feeding your mind.
Therefore, the tragedy continues."

My Lord,
When I was young,
You told me that I was too young
To accept the spiritual life.
And now that I am old, too old,
You are telling me
That I am not meant
For the spiritual life.
Why did You not tell me this
When I was still an adult
With my whole life ahead of me?
"My child,
Allow Me to explain.
You were meant
For the spiritual life,
But you were not ready,
You are not ready
And you will never be ready
For the spiritual life
Until you feel that the spiritual life
Is the only life,
And there is no other life for you."
