28 June 1999

7:46 a.m.

Before lifting 250 lbs. 3 times

with both arms simultaneously

(Total: 500 lbs.)

My Supreme, my Supreme, my Supreme!

From life to death,

From death to life

I travel,

Carrying the message

Of Your universal Victory.

My Supreme, my Supreme, my Supreme!

28 June 1999

8:01 a.m.

Before lifting 350 lbs. 58 times

with one arm

(29 right, 29 left)

My Supreme, my Supreme, my Supreme!

Every morning during my meditation,

You play Your Compassion-Flute

For my aspiration-heart

And You play Your Concern-Violin

For my dedication-life.

My Supreme, I am all gratitude to You.

My Supreme, my Supreme, my Supreme!

30 June 1999

8:42 a.m.

Before using seated

double-arm machine

up to 160 lbs.

with both arms simultaneously

and 190 lbs.

with each arm separately

My Supreme, my Supreme, my Supreme!

I wish to regain

My happiness-heart.

Do allow me to sit at Your Feet

And pray and meditate

Day and night

To regain my childhood happiness-heart.

My Supreme, my Supreme, my Supreme!

Before lifting 250 lbs. 3 times

with both arms simultaneously

(Total: 500 lbs.)

My Supreme, my Supreme, my Supreme!

You are telling me

That if I start laughing,

Then You will start smashing

One by one

All my problems.

My Supreme, my Supreme, my Supreme!

30 June 1999

9:04 a.m.

Before lifting 350 lbs.

with one arm

My Supreme, my Supreme, my Supreme!

I need only two things

In this life:

I need the Beauty

Of Your Compassion-Eye;

I need the Fragrance

Of Your Forgiveness-Heart.

My Supreme, my Supreme, my Supreme!
