A HERO WITH SOME DEFECTS

I got up late,
I made friends with ignorance-king,
I dined with darkness-prince,
I sang with imperfection-princess,
I danced with weakness-queen.

I must say,
These are all my little indulgences.
Yet
I am not what I was.
Alas,
I am now a hero with some defects.
Of course, these are all minor defects.

INTEGRITY

For integrity.

For integrity!
Integrity will run
To embrace you
If you just request
Your heart-friend
To look after it.
Just speak to your heart-friend.
Lo, all integrity is yours.
