In my aspiring heart.

What I need is more immensity

In my God-searching mind.

What I need is more humility

In my God-serving life.

My Supreme, my Supreme, my Supreme!

That a seeker does not need

Strict spiritual disciplines.

He does not need austerities.

He does not need the highest

And deepest meditation.

What he needs to realise You

Is only pure, pure, pure devotion.

You are also telling me

That all are equal in Your Sight,

But those who have sincere

Devotion to You

Have a very, very special place

In Your Heart,

And their hearts

Are Your choicest homes.

My Supreme, my Supreme, my Supreme!
