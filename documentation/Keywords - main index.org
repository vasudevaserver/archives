1. Keywords should always be singular and always lower case. Multiple keywords must be separated by a comma.

Example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  :KEYWORDS: master-disciple relationship, spiritual practice
#+END_EXAMPLE


** Editorial keywords (not referring to the Author's work)

- [to be added]


** Important: keywords as index

One should not mistake keywords for the "tags" label used on some websites.

In the domain of the Sri Chinmoy Archive, keywords serve as a rudimentary index (hopefully in the future there shall be a real index).

Also, because of that, the proper wording of the keyword is /very/ important.

Keywords must be selected only from the list above. If a needed keyword is not there, a proposal should be discussed and agreed upon.
