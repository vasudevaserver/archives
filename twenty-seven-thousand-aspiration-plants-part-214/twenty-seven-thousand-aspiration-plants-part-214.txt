Then our God-obedience-song

Because you are so stupid,
You dare to judge others.
O suspicion,
Because you are so useless,
You want the rest to be in your company.

Who is the Master's greatest pride?
The Master's greatest pride is the God-lover
Whose heart breaks into millions of pieces
When the Master is hopelessly swimming
In the sea of tears.

Who is the Master's greatest pride?
The Master's greatest pride is the God-lover
Who proudly, sleeplessly and breathlessly
Watches the Master flying
In Infinity's ecstasy-sky.
