/During Sri Chinmoy’s Christmas-New Year trip to Malaysia from 23 November 2005 to 25 February 2006, he visited six locations: Kuala Lumpur, Pangkor Island, Kuantan, Kijal, Penang and Langkawi Island.

As on previous Christmas trips, Sri Chinmoy often practised his heavy weightlifting in his hotel room in the small hours of the morning. In addition to his regular exercises, he concentrated on the seated double-dumbbell lift, using varying weights, ranging from 400 pounds to 1,004 pounds.

At these sessions, which were recorded on video, Sri Chinmoy continued his pattern established in previous years of offering an early morning prayer and performing one of his compositions on his blue violin—a segment which he calls “Sri Chinmoy the Eternal Beginner.” He would frequently sing these songs after playing them. Towards the end of the trip, Sri Chinmoy also played songs on the alto flute, viola, horn ocarina and unisphere./
