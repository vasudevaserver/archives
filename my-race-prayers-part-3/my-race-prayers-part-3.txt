/The following prayers were mostly offered by Sri Chinmoy at the conclusion of the weekly Saturday morning “Runners Are Smilers Two-Mile Races” held in New York. In 2002 Sri Chinmoy renamed them “Self-Transcendence Races.” During Christmas trips to other countries, additional races were held on other days of the week over shorter or longer distances. Sri Chinmoy frequently participated in these races./

Every morning
And every evening
My soul most devotedly records
The Nectar-flooded Discourses
Of my Lord Beloved Supreme.

Marathon is
An unimaginable joy-experience
Of the heart.
Marathon is
An unbearable suffering-experience
Of the body, the vital and the mind.

Short talk offered before the marathon:
I have invoked special Blessings of my Absolute Lord Beloved Supreme for all the marathon runners. Each marathon is an unimaginable joy for the runner’s heart. Again, each marathon is an unspeakable torture for the body, the vital and the mind. Our philosophy is to transcend -- transcend the physical pain and transcend our previous achievements. My blessings, my love and my gratitude I am offering to each and every runner.
And my special request to you all is this: when you find you are tired, extremely, extremely tired, exhausted, then do not continue, do not continue.
All my love. Start!

The fever of the body
Comes and goes.

Is torture unbearable.

Is rapture unimaginable.
