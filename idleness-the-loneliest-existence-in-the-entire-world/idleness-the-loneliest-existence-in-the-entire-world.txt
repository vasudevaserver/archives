Stupidity and futility both
Have inescapably
Befriended you?

Idleness,
Never do you want
To please God.
Never do you want
To love God.
Never do you want
To serve and fulfil God
In God's own Way.
Therefore, it is no wonder
That your mind is bound by sin
And your heart is bound by guilt!

Idleness,
When God asks you
To do something,
You always ask God
To show you how to do it.
While He is showing you
How to do it,
You purposely fall into
And enjoy
A deep and never-ending sleep.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

Dynamism says to idleness,
"My friend, my dear friend,
My oneness-friend,
Do not build towers
Without a foundation
Anymore.
Do not trust tomorrow.
Tomorrow is an old and expert
Deceiver.
It is high time for you
To leave the land
Of self-made fools.
Happily look every morning
At the rising sun.
Hope, without fail,
Will be your guardian angel.
God is showering upon you
His Heaven-Heart-Forgiveness-Blossoms.
Just place yourself at His Feet
With your mind's prayerful readiness,
Your heart's soulful willingness
And your life's cheerful eagerness."
