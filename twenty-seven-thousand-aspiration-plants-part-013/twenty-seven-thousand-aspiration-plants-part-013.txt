God wants you to do Him a favour
Before He does you a favour.

For a few fleeting minutes,
And then, what He will do,
You know:
For hours and hours

To play with Him:
A mind empty of criticism,
A heart empty of fear,
A life that is neither
Afraid of the world's criticism
Nor afraid of Heaven's indifference.

The spiritual life totally.
He promised himself
That he would never think of God,
Or speak about God,
Or even look at God
If God appeared before him.

Today he hears from everyone
That God has made him
His choice instrument
To shatter the doubts
Of all human beings.
Now he says to himself,
"Alas, good news has come
At such a wrong time!"

If I could say a few nice things
About Krishna and Buddha.
I said, "Of course, of course.
They are my Eternity's friends.
Every day I see them.

When I go from earth to Heaven,
Buddha places his wisdom-peace-bridge
Before me
For me to go up to Heaven.
Every evening
When I return from Heaven to earth,
Krishna places his love-delight-bridge
Before me
For me to come down to earth."

An unforgivable sin,
And that sin is
That you have totally given up

Please tell me why You have
An unlisted number.
"My child,
It is a top secret,
But anyhow I am telling you.
Both Heaven and earth bother me
Like anything.
I am totally sick of them.
Every day Heaven has to invite me
To participate in its birth anniversaries,
And every day earth has to invite me
To participate in its death anniversaries.
I am totally sick of them,
And therefore I don't allow them
To call me whenever they want to.
Whenever I want to call them
And bless them and illumine them,
I do call.
This is the only reason
Why I have an unlisted number."
