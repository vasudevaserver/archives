How proud God will be of you
If you do.

Only to sink and fail.
But the Master himself
Can never ultimately fail,
For his is a God-ordained mission.

Purity unites.
Because God is pure,
He is One:
He is His Heart's Oneness-Song
In His Life's Fulness-Dance.

If it is possible
To create pride inside your mind,
Impurity will do it.
Alas, it has already
Done the damage.

If it is possible
To create insecurity inside your heart,
Impurity will do it.
Alas, it has already
Done the damage.

O my mind's confusion-bound intellect,
You are imperfect, to say the least!

You are not aware of what you are doing
Or where you are.
When will you learn
That satisfaction-smile abides
Only in intuition-core?
