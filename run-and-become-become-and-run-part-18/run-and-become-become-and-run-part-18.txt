Yesterday, when I was running a race in Australia, two runners went ahead of me. As they were passing me, one of them told the other, "This guy is everything! Turn around!" Both of them turned and looked at me.

Then, right after the race, somebody else came up to me and started asking me about food. He said, "Why do you not allow people to eat meat and fish?" I simply smiled at him.

This second experience happened immediately after the race, when I was so tired and exhausted. That is why I was not in the mood to answer the question.

When I was out walking, just across from Agni Press, about five young boys around twelve or thirteen years old came right up in front of me and stood there with folded hands.

One of them said to me, "O great man, I bow to thee!"

I said to the boy, "I bless you."

The boy was so startled: "What! You bless me!"

I said, "If you are bowing to me, then why should I not bless you!"

Then the boys ran away.

During the New York Marathon, I was crossing the street around the six-mile mark. All of a sudden somebody grabbed me and embraced me.

It was an older gentleman from Hawaii who had run one of our races. He said, "My wife and I are your great admirers. We ran your 24-hour race, and tomorrow we shall come to your concert at Lincoln Center."

He was wearing all kinds of plants and leaves around himself and a Hawaiian skirt. It was his costume for the New York Marathon.

  :END:


I came down to the lobby of the Sun Route Hotel in Tokyo around five o'clock in the morning in order to go running. I wanted to run for forty-five minutes or so. I was determined that I would not make any wrong turns or get lost, because I wanted to come back in an hour.

But God wanted me to run longer! I was running and running and, as usual, I totally forgot my landmarks. So I got lost very nicely.

Finally, at six-thirty, I said, "Now I have to make inquiries." So I started asking people where the Sun Route Hotel was. When I said, "Sun Route," they did not understand my English. I had to say, "Sun Routo." But even then nobody could help me.

I said, "Fine, nobody knows where it is!" So I continued my journey. Then I saw a taxi driver and I asked him for directions. He spoke English well. He said to me, "It is quite far. You get in."

I said, "But I have no money."

He said, "Oh no, you do not have to pay."

I told him, "But I want to run."

"It is quite far," he said again.

I said, "I will enjoy running."

He was so nice. He took a sheet of paper and wrote down the directions. "You go to the station and make a right turn."

So I continued running and came to the station, which was quite far. But instead of making a right turn, I made a left turn and got lost once more. Then I saw a policeman, who showed me which was the right direction.

Finally, I got tired and started walking. God knows where I was. Then I saw Projjwal and Pravaha running along the street. I said, "That means the hotel is very near."

They told me, "Make a left turn and then a right." Then they continued running.

For me, right and left are all the same! So again I got lost. Finally, I took a taxi back to the hotel because I was tired of running. The taxi ride lasted seven minutes. Altogether, for two hours I was out running and walking.

During our race in Fukuyama, I was running along the one-mile course. I saw Padmasini running about forty metres ahead of me. She was alone.

There was a big stone marking the turn-around point, but she did not go up to the stone. Before reaching it, she just turned around and went back. I thought, "How clever Padmasini is! There is such a big mark at the turn-around point, but she pretends not to see it."

I thought that since nobody was there, she was taking a shortcut. But I did not have the heart to say anything. Afterwards, I found out that she had already finished the race and was just doing some more walking and running.

Four or five times in Japan I saw Senani running. When I see somebody who is older than I am jogging and running, it gives me such joy and inspiration. I can only walk and limp; but he is so tall and his strides are so long. I was admiring him from the bottom of my heart.

When elderly people run or do physical exercise, it inspires the younger generation. In the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Nolini started running again after turning 65. Some of you people are 28 or 29, but you are acting as if you were ancient.

Those who do physical activity give me immense joy, and those who do not take exercise have to develop a new heart to feel my sadness.

Always people stop me at the 300-metre mark of our race course in Flushing Meadow Park. Yesterday, before the "Runners Are Smilers" race, somebody stopped me at that mark and said, "Can you tell me how to get to the train station?"

Then today it happened again. I was warming up before the start of our five-mile race. At about my second mile, which was at the 300-metre mark on the course, a runner came up to say hello. "Do you have the time?" he asked.

I said, "I have no watch, so I am not sure. It is around seven-thirty. The race has not started, so you will not miss it."

He said, "But I want to practise."

Then he went to one of the disciples to ask the time. That disciple told him, "It is exactly seven-thirty." Then the runner was reassured and he went to practise. Every time I go to the 300-metre mark, somebody comes and asks me for something. That is the place!

When I was meditating early this morning, at exactly a quarter to three Trishakash's soul came to me for very special blessings. So I blessed and blessed his soul, pouring utmost divine light into it. I was very pleased with how much his soul received. When his blessing was over, I blessed other souls.

At 3:15 Alo happened to call. After my conversation with Alo, I took some stretching exercises. Then I went downstairs to attempt to lift 200 pounds. Unfortunately, I only pushed the weight up about four inches; so I still have eight more inches to go! Then I lifted some other weights and did various exercises. How many exercises I took upstairs and downstairs!

Shortly before 5:30, I went out for a run. As soon as I came out of my house, I said to myself, "How I wish Trishakash would come down this weekend so I can tell him the juicy story about this morning's blessing."

As usual, I began running on the edge of the street because the asphalt is softer than the cement sidewalk. When I reached my 300-metre mark on 1 50th Street, all of a sudden I saw a car come to a stop very close to me.

A very tall, strong man came out of the car. O God, it was Trishakash! What was he doing there in Queens at that hour of the morning!

Another disciple, a young boy, was in the car. He was astonished to see me at that hour. They had both just arrived from Canada.

Trishakash screamed, "O Guru!"

He was standing on one side of the car, and I was standing on the other. I was shouting at him-as if he were deaf-telling him the story about his soul.

When I was looking at him, I was seeing not his body but his soul; his soul was on his face. His face, his eyes, his ear-everything-was all soul!

So you see, there is something called the soul. You have to believe it! The body is unreal, but the soul is so real. The real thing you do not see or value. But when the real thing is pleased with you, then it is something! And when the real thing is displeased with you, at that time everything in the inner world is dislocated.

So today Trishakash's soul was very pleased with him.

He told me, "O Guru, today is my birthday." A few days ago I had known his birthday was coming soon, but this morning, when his soul had come to me, it was not in my mind.

* Morning Blessings

  :END:


This morning I went out to run at around six o'clock. At that time my disciples were all meditating at home, but I was meditating on the street while running. As usual, my route was along Queens Boulevard. I stopped only once, at the Main Street intersection, and rested a little because my body demanded it. So I surrendered to my body and then started running again.

On the way back, I was in a very high consciousness -- in another world. All of a sudden, I saw the soul of one of our newer disciples from the New York Centre. Her soul asked me for special blessings so she could fulfil the inner promises she had made this year. I was very pleased. Immediately I blessed the soul with utmost concern and poured solid determination into the soul. Then, shortly afterwards, I saw someone on the street who looked like my rabbi, Sanatan. I was on the street and he was on the sidewalk. There was a van and a car in between us, but his vibration I still got.

Around my 400-metre mark on 150th Street, I was dying with exhaustion. Then I saw someone running towards me, but I could not recognise her. When she passed me, immediately I felt the vibration of her soul. Although my eyes could not recognise her, I got a vibration from her soul. It was the same New York disciple whom I had blessed earlier.

So I stopped and screamed at her. She also stopped. I told her, "I just blessed your soul. Go straight and make a left turn to my 900-metre mark. Then stand there and meditate."

Hundreds of things like this happen every day. I do not tell you people how many times your souls come to me for special blessings, affection and love. But your souls come to me only if you are in a good consciousness. If you are in a bad consciousness, your souls know how to sleep! If you are sincere, if you are determined, then your souls will definitely come to me again and again for extra blessings, affection, concern and determination to fulfil your promises.

At the inauguration of the Sri Chinmoy Peace Mile in London, the weather was mild and excellent. It was very unusual for England. Believe it or not, the sun actually came out! Everybody was so happy that we were blessed by the presence of the sun.

All around the one-mile loop there were beautiful blue flags, quite small, and large pictures of important runners. They started with Robert de Castella's picture, then some English runners, and ended with Sebastian Coe's picture-as if he were finishing first.

There were also twelve stone plaques on the course with the inscription 'Sri Chinmoy Peace Mile.' There was also a big plaque that told our ideals and philosophy in a nutshell.

Thirty metres away from the starting line there were four golden statues of Lord Buddha in a peace pagoda. Right near the start was the River Thames, which runs along about 800 metres of the course. It was all very beautiful!

I always speak about enthusiasm. This time the British have shown enthusiasm from beginning to end. How cheerfully they worked together! In terms of happiness, enthusiasm, warmth and oneness, this race far surpassed all the races we have ever held, including those in New York. I always say, "Become, and then go beyond." So they have become one with all the good qualities that New York offers in its races, and they have gone far beyond.

The big shots who came were so nice! How kindly and respectfully they talked to me. I was so deeply moved.

So many runners came to the inauguration of our Peace Mile in London. Many were former Olympians-some from 1948, some from 1956. There was also a British Olympian who had stood fourth in the 10,000-metre race in the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984. Now he is training for the next Olympics.

I had a very long talk with him. I said, "You will get another chance in Korea."

He replied, "This time, if I do not get a medal, I will give up." He had seen a video of me lifting 200 pounds and he was very impressed. He said he used to lift 40 pounds, but it was too much for him.

I said, "You do not need to do it."

There was also a runner from Iran who holds eight Asian records. He was very humble and very nice. He was appreciating me like anything, and I also was appreciating him. He feels I have special blessings from Allah. He also gives all credit to Allah for his running success.

Then, an ex-Olympian from the 1948 Olympics came over to introduce himself to me. He said, "I am a friend of Dhrubha Hein's father." This world of ours is so small! Here I was in London and I met a friend of Dhrubha's father.

The BBC came and interviewed me for a long time at the inauguration ceremony. Then they wanted me to run with the children. So I ran with the children.

From the beginning to the end my place was fixed: last. When I started, I had barely covered 100 metres when the children were at 400 metres. They were so fast!

One lady was wheeling her child in a perambulator. She was ahead of me. Then something happened at around 300 metres, and she fell down. I felt miserable!

Afterwards, the father of the girl who had stood first in the competition begged me to be in a photograph with his daughter. She had defeated me badly, so he was very proud of her. The father was the photographer, and he took a very nice picture.

Unfortunately, I did not care for that statue. So after we had taken the picture that he wanted, I asked him to stand in front of another statue for another picture. According to me, this second statue was infinitely better.

At that time his photographer was missing. We had two photographers of our own, but he wanted to have his own photographer. So we had to wait.

The Mayor was shouting: "Where has he gone! Where has he gone!" Finally, his photographer came and took the picture.

Dan comes from England, but he acts like an Indian; his soul is all joy. He is like a Heavenly angel. His smile, his movements, everything about him is angelic. Each time you see him, it is like seeing a continuously blossoming flower.

Dan is so nice. How many times he has come up to me to shake hands! Sometimes I am in a serious mood, but his smiling face immediately takes away my seriousness.

Then, when I came to the 800 metre mark, one of the runners ran by me. After going three or four metres ahead, he turned around and gave me the broadest smile. His soul was on his face; so when he turned around, it was his soul that smiled. It was the same soul that I had seen and blessed at the 700-metre mark. His name is Siggy Bauer.

In just thirty or forty seconds from the time I blessed his soul, his soul was able to convince his mind, and that was his response.

The first time he took prasad, he told someone that he felt he was in Heaven.

This afternoon I went out walking. As I was coming back, I saw an older lady mowing her lawn. The lawn was on a small hill that came down to the sidewalk. She must have accidentally pulled out the electric plug to her lawnmower and let go, because suddenly it started rolling down the hill towards the street. The lady was standing there screaming, "Oh! Oh! Oh!"

Nowadays I am unable to run at all, but when I saw the lawnmower rolling towards the street, I came running over to grab it. I was afraid it might hit a car and cause an accident.

The lady was holding her hand on her heart. "Oh, thank you, thank you! You are such a nice man," she said.

But her friend, who was standing next to her on the lawn, said, "Why do you have to thank him? It was his duty!"

Today the picture of me lifting twenty-six runners from our Marathon Team has appeared in New York Newsday. While we were watching the New York Marathon, Ranjana found the newspaper in a candy store.

The owner of the candy store asked me, "Are you from Trinidad or India?"

I said, "I am from India."

He told me that he was from Gujarat.

I said, "Gujarat has produced many eminent persons," and I named one very famous Gujarati.

He asked, "Is he still alive?"

I said, "Unfortunately, he is dead."

"Are you sure?" he asked.

"I am sure," I replied. "His wife is also dead."

He said that he had been in America for fifteen years, so he was not in touch with what was happening in Gujarat. I did not have the heart to tell him that I have been in America for twenty-two years.

* Screaming "sri Chinmoy"

During the New York Marathon, Ranjana kept screaming "Sri Chinmoy" to get the disciples' attention as they ran by. When she would call the disciples by their own names-like Abarita and others-they did not respond. It seems they had forgotten their own names. But when Ranjana screamed "Sri Chinmoy," they looked over.

One disciple went at least fifty metres past me. Then, when he heard "Sri Chinmoy," he came back fifty metres just to look at me.

One photographer heard Ranjana screaming my name so many times that he climbed on top of the wall where she was standing to ask how to spell and pronounce it. Then he asked all about me.

Two times I saw Mohan and Anjali running together. The first time, at three or four miles, they were laughing and laughing. I was screaming at them, but they were in the seventh Heaven of delight, and they did not notice me.

After eight or nine miles, the course became very narrow and everybody had to go to one side of the street. At that time I saw them and they also saw me.

While I was watching the New York City Marathon from the sidewalk, many times I raised my hand when I saw disciples running.

Four or five times other people hit my hand with their hand as they were running by. They hit me so hard!

One or two recognised me, and while touching me said, "Sri Chinmoy!" But some just gave me a slap.

One runner, when he saw me, stopped and hugged me. He said, "You have helped me so much in my life!"

The man was wearing a T-shirt that said, "Jack."

His running partner could not believe what he was doing. He kept asking Jack, "Who is it? Who is it?"

I was crossing from one side of the street to the other because somebody told me that Lavanya and Nilima were coming on the other side. As I was crossing, one of the runners said, "Look at that idiot!"

Afterwards, I became more alert. I would run a little ahead of the people coming and then cross.

At the eight-mile point, a thin, old man came up to me and grabbed my hand. He said, "Sri Chinmoy, Sri Chinmoy, God bless you! Please pray for me." At eight miles he was already feeling dead.

* No Sympathy

After the marathon, one runner was making a phone call. I heard everything he said because I was standing behind him, waiting to use the phone. The runner had a bandage around his right quadricep. He was begging his brother to come and pick him up. God knows what the brother said.

Then the man called someone else, whom he called "Honey." But this person also did not want to come.

Then he called "Mum." But Mum also said no. She was the third person to refuse him. Then he said such a nasty word to his mother over the phone.

Afterwards, I saw him cross the street to get the bus. Poor fellow, once he had to cross the street to make the phone calls, and again he had to cross to go to the bus stop.

I made calls to four different places: Annam Brahma, my house, Ashrita's house and one more place.

The man behind me was so annoyed. Perhaps he thought I was dialing the same number each time.

He said, "What is the matter with you? Why are you dialing again and again?"

First he had to wait for the injured man to call all his relatives. Then he had to wait for me.

While some of the slower runners were still running, the organisers started taking down the equipment.

Many years ago I had that experience when I was running the New York City Marathon. What an insult! The first insult was not enough-that Chameli went ahead of me! Then came the second insult: I saw the police taking down the wooden barricades while I was still running.

John has my heart's deepest appreciation for two reasons. First, he did extremely well; his timing was 2:32. Also, he was running side by side with Greta Waitz for such a long, long time. So many times his Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team T-shirt was clearly visible on television. I was so delighted and excited to see it on TV. It had a very special inner significance.
