The Infinite is She. Therefore infinite was my folly to have ventured my pen to set forth her life ever unknowable. But the Mother's Bounty is infinitely more powerful than my error, however grave.

Since the dawn of earth-time the Mother as the Shakti has walked the soil along with her Divine Compeers, the Avatars. Alas, our ignorance paid no heed to her supernal Love and Grace. To the Avatars alone we built our altars. Their Shaktis remained almost concealed, and at times even ignored by humanity. Unnoticed, as it were, they appeared on the scene and unnoticed they disappeared.

But according to our Master, "In her deep and great love for her children she has put on the cloak of this obscurity, condescended to bear the attacks and torturing influences of the Falsehood, borne to pass through the portals of the birth that is a death, taken upon herself the pangs and sorrows and sufferings of the creation, since it seemed that thus alone could it be lifted to the Light and Joy and Truth and eternal Life. This is the great sacrifice called sometimes the sacrifice of the Purusha, but much more deeply the holocaust of the Prakriti, the sacrifice of the Divine Mother."

But this time our Mother, the Mother of the Golden All, has accepted the human cloak at her sweet will with her boundless Power for the full manifestation of the Divine here on earth. Her mission in life is to create a transformed humanity.

She is the sole hope of Nectar-Bliss for those who are burning with an unquenchable thirst for the unique Birth. And She will be crowned with Triumph only when we, her children, cease to be the finite.

February 21, 1878

O Asia, O Ind, O tree
And the high and proud enormous bough.
Devour your blind and naked pride.
The time is ripe for you to bow

With all your great past blotted out.
Ours alone is the Mother of gleam.
The One has fertilised your large land
To reap in mirth the Light supreme;

Therefore your haughtiness knew no bound.
A galaxy of flames and seers,
Avatars were born in you to found
The Life divine in a world of tears,

And for the fusion of East and West.
But all their efforts ended in smoke.
Behold, the Mother's advent a Grace
Protecting all with a sun-wide cloak.

She is the Bridge unique, divine
Between the two extremities.
Her Birth declares, "All souls will live
With the One in a fire-pure release."

My sister sweet, your eyes are dim,
Too narrow and brief their view.
The Mother for all, all souls will thrive
Under her ruby-Blessing dew.

With Spirit's flame surcharged is my soil;
Therefore her Feet of Light
On my breast shall rest; with scarce a toil
To free the earth from Ignorance' blight.

Her Birth you cherish and I her Play.
She is our deathless Hope.
She is Mother of eternal Day.
No more in gloom we shall grope.

(The English Channel)

I am the ceaseless surge of unique delight.
Two are the flames that kiss the highest height
And the deepest deep no one beholds save I.
One is in Paris, the other in England's eye.

My breadth is the hyphen white between the twain.
Their union is hid in dull Time-brain.
The rapture flood of their diamond amity
In years thirty and five the world will see.

He and She my left and right, with them I shine.
He is the Supreme and She the Mother divine.
To lift the doleful earth to heaven's height
Their human birth and forms of endless Might.

Five years have laboured in a secret light
To build her outer form.

Sudden a pressure storm
Stupendous She feels on her body's little crown.
Too strong yet a deep delight,
The pressure immeasurable of brooding earth
Seeking the end of its night.

Our mother's human brother saw the earth
Eighteen long years before his sister of lore.
Tranquillity was in flood in Mother's core,
But to ruthless ire he opened his bosom's door.

One day he saw his anger as hell's own breath;
He pushed it for ever far with his hero-will;
And from that hushful hour he cherished its death,
And lived true kin to his sister-sovereign-still.

A flood of joy that knows no mete am I.
Mother, with my dulcet flotes I bow to Thee.
The ocean-grey hound Thou ridest, anon thy eyes
Shall clasp the Light of the worlds in ecstasy.

Prithee, bestow on me a largess high.
My giant breast now serves thy cloak of love.
A candid rosy desire tortures my heart.
Mother, I know, I am thy eternal dove.

My child, your choice immaculate I fulfil.
By you I shall dwell with my deathless human Frame.
From here the Supreme and I shall guide the worlds.
And this your boon unique -- a ceaseless fame.

Influence divine to avert the stroke of doom.

In Heaven

"Swarna, my dear sister, what now compels
Your dawn-pure eyes to swim in the sea of tears?
My heart breaks into a million fragments now.
Take off the garment of your gloomy fears."

"Sister, console my ravaged heart, I beseech.
Alas, my sweet Auro has left the earth.
Sombre pangs torture the deep heart of the vast.
No longer his Soul enjoys the human birth."

"Ah, that away you threw your eyeless dule.
All from self-choice He has stopped
his heartbeat's march.
He has left the flesh and blood and nothing more.
Are you all void by his withdrawing search?
Ecstasy, a stupendous ecstasy shall soon
Enflood your within, without, my sister sweet.
To bring on earth his golden Sun ere long
He has left his body's shrine, his human retreat.

Auro and Mira are one in Spirit's gold fire.
No fate dare divide their timeless union.
She breathes his Breath limitless august, supreme...
A seed of a newer Birth, a newer Sun."

Mother, truly ungrateful are

Alas, in return they call me names.
Their missiles dire now hound
My aeonless breast from dawn to dusk;
To their hatred I am bound.

Mother:

Offspring, speak out the blue-gold truth.
Where are your words of mail ?
Why dungeon-mates of your sombre past
Why ego at you must rail?

Man:

During our ignorance-dawn she was
Our lonely teacher pure.
But we claimed not our heritage.
So this breach we needs must endure.
Spirit our only changeless guide.
To It alone we bow.
Save It our deathless Form is void.
Thou art the Tree and It the bough.

Mother:

Ego, my erring, doleful child,
Aside you cast your ire.
Inevitable was your gift.
Man now needs the Spirit's Fire
To change his face and sombre fate.
The sky-vast golden Dawn
Can alone slake his sleepless thirst.
He my lion, you my fawn.
