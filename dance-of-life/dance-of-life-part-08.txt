MOTHER'S DAY AND FATHER'S DAY

Mother's Day is great
Because
At least once a year
Children allow their minds
To think of their mother's heart
And
Allow their hearts to house
And treasure their mother.

Father's Day is great
Because
At least once a year
Each father tells his children
That he really wants to equal the
Heavenly Father in Compassion and Concern.

You and your Supreme feel it.
America's fate is exactly the way
You and your Supreme shape it."

URGENT BUSINESS

Mother Mary, Please tell me, where is your son?
I have been searching and searching for him
In the ecstasy-sun of Heaven.
I have something most important
To discuss with him.

"Son,
Are you here?
For the last ten years
My Jesus has been searching and searching for you
In the ignorance-sea and hell-fire of earth.
He has left me a note saying
He has a piece of urgent business
With you on earth."

MY LORD, WHAT WILL HAPPEN?

My Lord, what will happen if I deceive You?
"Son, I shall simply die."
My Lord, what will happen if You deceive me?
"Son, nothing will happen to you.
Your ignorance-friends
Will console you, strengthen you,
To pay Me back in My own coin.
But in My case, if you, My all,
Ever deceive Me, I shall simply die,
Since I have no other friend and none to call My own."
