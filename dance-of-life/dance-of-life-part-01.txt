#+BEGIN_VERSE

I BUTCHERED YOUR IGNORANCE

When I thought I was the doer
Of all my deeds,
I turned to mist.
I died.
I became the emperor of giant failures.
My soul came to the fore,
Consoled my visionless ignorance.
God made His Appearance supreme.
"You fool, be not wedded to impossibility's lifeless beauty.
I waste not a leaf.
I butchered your ignorance wild for you
To equal My Transcendental Throne."

SHE WAS THE SUPREME AUTHORITY

As the Queen of the universe.

On human failure

WHEN I SAY

When I say,
"God is powerful,"
The world is ready to endorse my view.

When I say,
"God is considerate,"
The world hesitates to endorse my view.

When I say,
"God is impartial,"
The world endeavours to negate my view.

When I say,
"God is merciful,"
The world devours my view.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

WHEN I INSULTED

I insulted God.
In return
He infused wisdom-light
Into my eyeless mind.

I insulted the world.
In return
The world landed death-blows on me.

I insulted my inner strength.
In return
It compelled my fall:
A clean cut forest tree.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

THE RESULT OF WORLD-ACCEPTANCE

He was a stalwart spiritual figure.
Above blemish he always was.
He loved the world deeply and unconditionally.
No response.
He dispatched his frustrated
Failure to the other world.
He fought and fought
Against his own solid realisation
Until he passed
Behind
The curtain of eternity.
The realisation read:
"In your world-acceptance
You fostered in your life-breath
A venom-snake."

IN THE GRAND OLD DAYS

In the grand old days
My thought was my life's sole pole-star.
My mouth and my heart,
In forms they were two
But
In spirit they were one.
I saw God, my All.
He embraced me.
He needed my love.
I demanded His Love.
His Love nullified all my
Vainglorious power in a twinkling.
My love developed into
A hushed silence.
In that silence grew a seething
Amazement:
My death in God's Immortality
And
God's Immortality in my death
Bloomed in excellence supreme.

PRETENCE NO MORE

I live in a zone of silence
To decipher my hostile past.
No, my life is not
A speck of dust
Flawed and doomed to nothingness.
Useless words I pronounced.
Therefore suicide I committed
Time and again.
In my life from now on
Only
The essential is permissible.
No more shall I pretend to be
What I am not:
IGNORANCE.

AT LAST I SHALL LISTEN

My past is heavy with
The lifeless
Meaning.
A frightened thought
My fast-approaching future
Is.

Of hope completely in my

I shout at the top of my lungs.
My soul embodies the weight of
Despair.
At last I am now learning the art of listening
To God's
Voice.
"Son, in your soulful silence is
My fruitful message,
My All."

World.
And here I bring the remedy:
Nectar-flood.
I cry with man
And
Smile with God.

IN THE CORE OF SILENCE

Yes, I was deported
To a distant
Land uncharted
By the eyeless hunger of ignorance-sea.
A wait-and-see attitude
Failed
To breathe within my
Reality's throes.
Burning with impatience-noon
My dauntless vital horse
Freed me from the sea
Of ignorance unplumbed.
And now, here I remain,
Here
In the snow-capped core of
Silence,
Alone, all alone, unchallenged,
Triumphant,
Eternity's pride, Lord eternal
Supreme.

A SYMBOL OF PROMISE

Every life is a rich
Storehouse

We live not,

In an epoch of
Chaotic decay.
I plumb the depths

Every life
Is a symbol of
Promise,
Streaming forth from a realm
Where
No one is a stranger, unwanted
None,
Where Love blossoms for the One
And Truth for the many.

My reward is a magnificent disaster
Of a universal tornado-character.

Dawn and a brighter sun.
In my Heart-Dawn, my preparation shall begin.
In my Soul-Sun, my perfection shall bloom.

God's Love is invited by me to play.
My heart of gratitude,
My life of surrender
Will watch them sing and play.

Prepare yourself for the world Beyond
Where joy is married to Eternity's Life."

Is to become a chosen instrument of God.

To meditate on Her
Is to reach the heights of Paradise unchallenged.

To see Her
Is to sit on Infinity's Transcendental Throne.

To feel Her
Is to become Immortality's Bliss.

Once before the beginning of Life
in the Heart of Silence,
Once after the end of Death
in the Head of Sound."
