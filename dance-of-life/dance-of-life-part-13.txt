THE CONNECTING LINK

Master, God has blessed me with money;
You now bless me with realisation.

Son, God has not only blessed you with money,
But also with realisation -
The realisation of temptation and frustration.
Your money is the connecting link
Between
God the temptation
And
God the frustration.

PROCESSIONS

Insecurity is a one-man procession.
It comes back to the place where it started.

Fear is a ten-man procession.
It comes back to the place where it started.

Jealousy is a twenty-man procession.
It comes back to the place where it started.

Doubt is a hundred-man procession.
It comes back to the place where it started.

But
Love is a ten million-man procession.
Once it reaches its destination, Illumination,
It never returns.
