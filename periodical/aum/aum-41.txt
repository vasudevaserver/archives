* The supreme secret of meditation[fn:: AUM 528. The University of Maryland — April 23, 1969]

Meditation is man’s real thirst for the Infinite real, Eternal real and Absolute real. The secret of meditation is to achieve conscious and constant oneness with God. The secret supreme of meditation is to feel God as one’s very own, God for God’s sake, Him to reveal and Him to fulfil.

Meditation has to be practised spontaneously, soulfully and correctly. If not, dark doubt will blight your mind, utter frustration will steal into your heart. Also it is highly likely that you will discover your whole existence thrown into the depths of a yawning chasm.

For meditation you need inspiration. Scriptures can supply you with inspiration. To buy a spiritual book, it takes ten seconds. To read that book, it takes a few hours. To absorb that book, it takes a few years. And to live the truths thereof it may take not only a whole lifetime, but a few incarnations.

For meditation you need aspiration. The presence, physical or spiritual, of a spiritual teacher can awaken your sleeping aspiration. He easily can and he will gladly do it for you. Aspiration, this is what you precisely need in order to reach your journey’s goal. You don’t have to worry about your realisation. Your aspiration will take care of it.

Meditation nourishes your self-discipline. Self-discipline strengthens your meditation. Meditation purifies your heart. In your pure heart alone looms large the Godward march of human life. One may know what proper meditation is. One may even practise it since that is what the divine nature in man needs. But the result or fulfilment of meditation transcends all human understanding, for it is measureless, limitless, infinite.

Meditation tells you only one thing: God /is/. Meditation reveals to you only one truth: yours is the vision of God.

To my extreme sorrow, some of you in the west have grave misconception of meditation. You feel that the acme of meditation is fortune-telling or miracle-mongering. Fortune-telling does not rhyme with meditation. Miracle-mongering does not rhyme with meditation either. But realisation perfectly rhymes with meditation. Liberation soulfully rhymes with meditation. Do you really want to realise God? Do you really want God’s infinite Light, Peace and Bliss? If so, you should keep millions and billions of miles away from fortune-tellers and miracle-mongers. If you think that they inspire you, then you are mistaken. Go deep within and you will discover the simple fact that they have just aroused your idle, eyeless and fruitless curiosity. Curiosity is no spirituality. Secretly and consciously they have offered to you something more: Temptation. Temptation is the harbinger of destruction. It is here that the divine mission of our life, unsuccessful, unfulfilled comes to an end. Let us be on the alert. I urge you not to confuse your heart’s genuine meditation with fortune-telling and miracle-mongering. Don’t waste your time. Your time is precious. Your meditation is priceless. Your achievements shall be the treasures of timeless eternity, measureless infinity and deathless immortality. Don’t wait. All things come to him who waits, except the realisation that ‘today’ embodies and the liberation that ‘now’ reveals.

Meditation is our soul’s cry for our life’s perfect perfection. Perfection has not yet dawned on earth, but one day it will. Perfection is the ideal of the human life. To quote Swami Vivekananda: “None of us has yet seen an ideal human being and yet we are told to believe in him. None of us has yet seen an ideally perfect man and yet without that ideal we cannot progress.”

Meditation alone can give birth to perfection. Meditation carries us beyond the frustration of the senses, beyond the limitation of the reasoning mind. Finally meditation can present us with the breath of perfection.

The ultimate aim of meditation is to realise the Supreme. The Katha Upanishad has a spiritual message to offer to the world. This message is an inner message.

“Higher than the senses are the objects of senses. \\
Higher than the objects of senses is the mind; \\
Higher than the mind is the intellect. \\
Higher than the intellect is the Great Self. \\
Higher than the Great is the Unmanifest. \\
Higher than the Unmanifest is the Person. \\
Higher than the Person there is nothing at all. \\
That is the goal. That is the highest course.”

Indeed, the Person is the Supreme Himself. On the strength of our highest and deepest meditation we unmistakably gain a free access to the Supreme.

At the beginning of our spiritual journey, we feel that meditation is self-effort, perspiration. At the end of our journey’s close, we realise that meditation is God’s Grace, His Compassion infinite.

Prices are never right. Before the realisation, it is too high. After the realisation it is too low.

“George Washington, first to embody America's hope,
First in inspiration, first in confidence, first in war,
First in victory,
First in conquering the heart of his Nation,
First to envisage a federation of states,
Single, powerful, united, whole.”

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

“Blessed is he who has found his work; let him ask no other blessedness.”

-- Carlyle

#+END_QUOTE


A spiritual person has found his work. His work is selfless service. His work is dedicated action. Indeed he needs no other blessedness. His action is the divine acceptance of earthly existence. And for this he needs a perfect body, a strong mind, a soulful heart and a supremely inspired life of inner receptivity and outer capacity.

Action is to enter into the battlefield of life. Action is to conquer life’s untold miseries and teeming limitations. Action is to transform life’s devouring imperfection into the glowing perfection. Action is something infinitely deeper and higher than mere survival of physical existence. Action is the secret supreme. This secret enables us to enter into the Life eternal.

He who has not consciously accepted the spiritual life may consider action a necessary evil and the mother of bitter frustration. But to a spiritual person, action is a divine blessing. It is the matchless victory over bondage and ignorance. It is at once God’s soulful Vision in heaven and God’s fruitful Mission on earth. God says that a man of divine action is the ideal hero. This ideal hero divine manifests God here on earth. To him, God-Realisation is not enough. His is the heart that cries for God’s all-fulfilling manifestation.

An unaspiring person dies and his role is over. An aspiring person dies and his role begins. A spiritual master leaves his body and his mission starts bearing fruit.

Man is blind. He does not know what to do. When he wants to do something, he does not know how to go about it and so, instead of getting joy from work, he immediately enters into difficulty.

T. H. Huxley pointedly remarks:	“A man’s worst difficulties begin when he is able to do as he likes.”

But if a man listens to the dictates of his soul and is able to do what the soul wants him to do, then his life will be transformed into golden opportunities and the greatest success will knock at his heart’s door.

Chazal said: “The thumb takes the responsibility, the index finger, the initiative.” Similarly man’s aspiration takes the initiative, but it is God’s Concern that takes the responsibility.

Again Chazal said: “The idealist walks on tiptoe, the materialistic on his heels.” Similarly a divine hero-worker walks on the fire of self-illumination; the worker undivine, unaspiring, uninspired and full of ego, vanity and pride walk on the fire of self-destruction.

According to some people, our human life is just a cruel, meaningless and hopeless four-letter word: Work. I wish to tell them that they are mistaken. They do like work. What they hate is the sense of labour, the burden of labour. Labour and favour perfectly rhyme. After all, whose favour is it? God’s favour. Indeed he is God’s chosen child and he alone is God’s favourite who works to please God. And in pleasing God, he realises and fulfils himself. And then he tells the world that the human life is a divinely meaningful three-letter word: Joy.



Liberation.  Liberation speaks: “We are not nature’s bond-slaves.” Liberation teaches. It teaches us that our every pulsation of the heart is a unique opportunity to achieve liberation. Liberation sings within us: “Arise, awake.” Yours is the ideal Goal, the Goal of Goals.

Liberation is man’s practical wisdom. Liberation is not a compromise with the world. Liberation is man’s end of competition with nature’s temptation. Liberation elevates the earth-consciousness into the skies of the Beyond.

What is more difficult -- to cry for liberation, or after having been liberated, to cry for the illumination and transformation of the ignorance-loving, darkness-embracing world? Undoubtedly the latter.

Poor liberated man, strange is his fate. He constantly thinks of those who hardly think of him. When he stands before the world, the world either acts like a frightened child or a hostile child. A liberated man tells the world that God is not only Knowable, but more than knowable. He also tells the world that it is easier to know God than to know the world because when he wants to know the world, he has to know it through God and from God.

Sri Krishna is illumination incarnate. The Buddha is liberation incarnate. The Christ is salvation incarnate.

The world is offering its Darkness to Sri Krishna. The world is offering its Suffering to the Buddha. The world is offering its Sin to the Christ.

The fallen consciousness of the world is flying towards the Highest Beyond to be touched by Christ, the Saviour. The broken consciousness of the world is diving into the Deepest Beyond to be felt by Buddha, the Liberator. The molten consciousness of the world is marching towards the Farthest Beyond to be blessed by Krishna, the Illuminator.

"What will happen, my god, if You and I become fully equal?"

"My child, when we two become fully equal, you will be known, as another God and I will be known as another man."

When I forget to think of God once, He smiles.
When I forget to think of God twice, He laughs.
When I forget to think of God thrice, He cries.

He smiles lovingly because I am helpless.
He laughs profoundly because I am hopeless.
He cries sincerely because I am shameless.

When I remember to think of God once, He blesses me.
When I remember to think of God twice, He caresses me.
When I remember to think of God thrice, He embraces me.

He blesses me, my life of aspiration.
He caresses me, my life of realisation.
He embraces me, my life of manifestation.
