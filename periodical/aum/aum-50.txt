1971 will be the year of divine, supreme, manifestation.

Those who have divine obedience will offer their divine obedience to the Supreme.

Those who have divine love will offer their divine love to the Supreme.

Those who have divine devotion will offer their divine devotion to the Supreme.

Those who have divine surrender will offer their divine surrender to the Supreme.

While offering obedience, love, devotion and surrender, the seeker will manifest these divine qualities on earth.

1971 is the year of divine manifestation.

Those who do not have any of these divine qualities -- obedience, love, devotion and surrender -- must feel that they are total failures in the spiritual life; absolute failures on the spiritual path. In the outer life they may succeed, the outer success they may achieve but, in God’s Eyes, they are zero, they are simply failures.

Those who have only obedience can feel that they are babies. Those who have love can feel that they are grown children. Those who have devotion can feel that they are now at the adolescent stage. And those who have surrender can feel that they are strong, stout, determined youth.

Now in surrender, we always say that unconditional surrender and constant surrender are needed. Unconditionally surrendered and constantly surrendered seekers are the seekers who can sit, who can stay on the top of the tree; and those who have just surrendered or surrendered for a day or two or for a few minutes, they are at the foot of the tree.

Others who have devotion, love and obedience, you can say they are running towards the tree and among them obedience -- so called obedience -- comes third. First devotion, second love, third obedience. But they are running. They will one day reach the tree, then they will stay at the foot of the tree and become surrendered and then gradually, if it is God’s Will, they will become unconditionally and constantly surrendered seekers, devotees.

This is the year of manifestation. For those who have faith in God-Realisation, this is the year for them to expedite their inner seeking. The year of manifestation is for those who want the Supreme for the Supreme; who want the Supreme for His Sake and not for their sake. Again I wish to say, this year of manifestation for our disciples, sincere disciples, will be the year of inner glory in God, in the Supreme’s highest and transcendental Pride. For the Supreme needs, as we need many things. He needs totally, unreservedly, unconditionally and constantly surrendered disciples, it is they who will be the torch-bearers of the Supreme, the Supreme Truth. The Supreme is inwardly crying for these constantly, unconditionally surrendered disciples.



* The Bhagavad-Gita -- Chapter XII {{{newline}}} The path of devotion

Arjuna is exceedingly happy and extremely fortunate that he has had the most rare Vision of the cosmic Form. How is it possible for him to be burdened with further philosophical and spiritual questions? The reason is that his vision of the cosmic Form does not imply that he has reached the Goal of goals. The vision has to be transformed into the living, constant Reality in Arjuna’s life and then he has to live in the Reality itself. The experience of the vision is good. The realisation of the vision is better. The embodiment of the vision is best. Better than even the best is the revelation of the vision. Finally it is the manifestation of the vision which is divinely and supremely unparalleled.

The path of meditation and the path of devotion are now being compared. Arjuna wishes to learn from Sri Krishna about the two paths, the path of meditation that leads to the Unmanifest and the path of devotion that leads to the personal God -- which is the better of the two? Krishna’s answer is that each path, devotedly and faithfully followed, leads to the Goal. But the path of meditation is more difficult and more arduous. The physical body binds us to the material world. Hence it is difficult for us to meditate on the Unthinkable, Unimaginable and the Transcendental. But if we approach the Lord who assumes the human form and who plays His divine game in the field of His manifestation, our success will undoubtedly be easier, quicker and more convincing, to a degree which our physical minds would not believe possible.

A genuine seeker must dissolve all that he has -- ignorance and knowledge -- and all that he is -- ego and aspiration -- in God. Indeed it is most difficult but not impossible. Lo! He is given the golden opportunity to accept the easiest and the most effective path. In this unique path, he has just to offer the fruits of action to the Lord and he has to dedicate himself -- body, mind, heart and soul -- to the Lord.

The path of meditation and the path of devotion will lead ultimately to the same Goal. Now what makes the aspirant feel that the path of meditation is extremely difficult to follow? The answer is very simple. The aspirant cannot focus his mind’s attention on the Unmanifest Beyond; whereas if the aspirant is devoted to the Lord in His manifested creation and if he wants to see and worship his Beloved in each being, his path becomes undoubtedly easier. Love the form first; then from the form, go to the Formless beyond. The disciple at the beginning must approach the divinely physical aspect of the Guru and then he has to go beyond, far beyond the Guru’s physical form and physical substance in order to commune and stay in the Ineffable and the Ever-Receding Beyond.

The disciple wants the easiest path. Sri Krishna kindly consents. He says that the path of meditation is difficult, the path of selfless service is difficult and the path inspired by Love and Devotion is difficult. But still there is one more path which is extremely easy to follow. In this path, one has merely to renounce the fruit of action. If we cannot do our work as a dedicated service to God, we should not succumb to dark disappointment. Just work, work for ourselves, but we need only offer our fruits to the Lord. However we will do well if we do only that particular work which we feel from within to be right. Naturally we will do the work that is demanded of us by our soulful duty. If we do our soulful duty and offer the fruits to the Lord, in no time our Inner Pilot is won.



* The Bhagavad-Gita -- The God Song chapter XIII {{{newline}}} The field and the knower of the field

  :END:


Devotion is more than enough to realise the Lord Krishna, the Truth Eternal. However, in this chapter Sri Krishna wants to widen Arjuna’s knowledge, philosophically and intellectually. Those who harbour philosophical and intellectual questions with regard to the Truth will now truly be satisfied.

We try to avoid and ignore that which creates problems in our life. According to Krishna, this so-called wisdom of ours is nothing short of ignorance. True, we shall not create problems on our own. But if the problems do appear, then we have to face them and enter into them and finally conquer them dauntlessly and totally.

Arjuna has already been blessed by the Lord with the inner heights. Now the Lord wants to illumine him with the knowledge of the Cosmos wherein he has to play a conscious role.

Matter and spirit. /Prakriti/ and /Purusha/. The Field and the Knower of the Field. The body is the field. The Soul is the Knower -- thereof. True wisdom lies in realising the Knower Supreme and the Cosmos, known and revealed.

There are twenty-four /Tattvas/, principles, that go to form the Field. The first group of great elements or bases are: Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Ether. The field also houses the ego and the earth-bound mind, the intellect. The five organs of action: hands, feet, tongue and the two organs of elimination. And also the sense organs such as nose, mouth, eyes, ears, etc. The five spheres of the senses are: sight, smell, taste, hearing and touch.

Only one thing is to be known. To know that the Lord is within the Cosmos, without the Cosmos and also beyond it is to know everything.



* Matter and spirit

  :PROPERTIES:

  :END:


Matter and Spirit are beginningless. Matter is the primordial substance, Matter is ever changing. Spirit is always static. Matter is the possessor of infinite qualities. Spirit sees and sanctions. Matter does, grows and becomes. Spirit is consciousness. Spirit is the Witness. Matter is the Creativity Infinite. Spirit is the Reality in man. Spirit is the Perceiver of Matter He who has realised Spirit’s eternal Silence and Matter’s (Prakriti’s) cosmic dance may live in any walk of life, whether as a doctor or as a philosopher, a poet or a singer; he has achieved the perfection of supreme realisation. There are some who realise the Supreme Spirit in meditation; others by knowledge (the Sankhya philosophy). There are also others who realise the Supreme Spirit by the Yoga of Action and Selfless Service. Still there are others who are not aware of It, but who have heard of the Supreme Spirit from others and who have started worshipping it in devotion and cling firmly to the Truth. They also pass on beyond mortality and cross beyond the snares of death.

Spirit is in Matter. It tastes the qualities born of matter. It does experience the physical existence. The qualities acquired determine its rebirth. Spirit is the Supreme Himself. Although Master of the body, It experiences mortal life.

The way to God is to see the Eternal Life in the fleeting life, to know that /Prakriti/, not /Purusha/, is to action attached. All activities, says the Gita, divine and undivine, arise in /Prakriti. Purusha/ is actionless. No action is possible in /Purusha/, for /Purusha/ transcends both time and space. Yet without /Prakriti/, there can be no universe, no manifestation.

Spirit is self existent and all-pervading, whether within the body or without the body; always unaffected the Spirit remains.

To know that /Purusha/ and /Prakriti/ are one and inseparable is to know the Truth, the Truth of Unity and the Divinity in humanity which will eventually be manifested as the Divinity of humanity.

The Gita does not house arid, logical metaphysics. At the same time, its teachings have no need for any support from intellectual argument. Human reason cannot knock at the door of Transcendental Reality. Never. What is the Gita, if not the Transcendental Reality supremely and divinely embodied?

Each human being has to learn five supreme secrets from the Gita.

1). See the Truth.
2). Feel the Truth.
3). Be the Truth.
4). Reveal the Truth.
5). Manifest the Truth.

In this chapter we observe that the Gita is at once the significance of life and the divine interpretation of life. Unfortunately, this particular chapter has become the victim of dire contradiction in spite of the very fact that the Gita, from its journey’s start to its journey’s close sees not the face of contradiction. The Gita sees and reveals only the face of Truth’s unity in multiplicity. Scholars and commentators are at war with each other over their theories. Nor have the philosophers the inclination to shun this battle. Each is inspired to impose his lofty theories on the others. But a genuine seeker of the Supreme Truth is truly wise. He prays to the Lord Krishna to have the Gita as his personal experience. Sri Krishna smiles. The devotee cries out:


#+BEGIN_QUOTE

"Thou that hast given so much to me,
Give one thing more, a grateful heart.
Not thankful when it pleaseth me,
As if thy blessings had spare days;
But such a heart, whose pulse may be Thy praise.

-- G. Herbert

#+END_QUOTE


Lo the devotee has won the race! The devotee needs a Guru, master. Sri Krishna is the Guru and Arjuna is the disciple. An eminent Indian scholar, Hari Prasad Shastri writes:


#+BEGIN_QUOTE

"Is the Guru, or Master, an absolute necessity to the realisation of Truth? The reply, according to the Gita, is "Yes". The Guru is the person who teaches the unity of the soul with the Absolute and who lives the life of /Sattva/. He can be of either sex and according to the Gita, need not be a recluse, living in the snows of the Himalayas, cut off from the world, speaking through chosen apostles only and sending fantastic letters through the "astral mail”. The Guru of the Gita is a man like any other good man, whom anyone can see at any convenient time, who lives in human society and does not claim any superiority over others."

#+END_QUOTE


Finally the Gita tells us that the Guru of all gurus, the real Guru is God.

/Yogi:/ The animal in you wants you to feel that God means destruction. The human in you wants you to feel that God is temptation. The divine in you wants you to feel that God means surrendering light and fulfilled height.

/Yogi:/ Yes, you are nearing the realisation of your teeming stupidity and not the realisation of your blooming divinity.

/Yogi:/ You fool. How can I betray God? At the very beginning, I promised you and God, that I would take you to Him. God needs you. And you need God and God alone. I am only the bridge.



* 55. My name is Erika. What is the difference between a liberated soul and a realised soul?

/Yogi:/ A liberated soul usually does not care for God-manifestation on earth. He feels that once he is liberated, his role in the cosmic drama is ended. A realised soul cries for God-manifestation. He feels that once he is realised, his role in the cosmic drama has properly begun. A liberated soul is freed from the meshes of ignorance and at the same time is extremely careful of wild ignorance. A realised soul has discovered his own inner divinity which is flooded with God's all-seeing vision and all-fulfilling reality. A liberated soul usually uses God according to his own capacity. A realised soul uses God only when asked by God Himself. The human and the unreal in us cease in liberation. The divine and the real in us begin in realisation.



* 56. My name is Herbert. Which is more important of the two, God’s Grace or God’s Justice?

/Yogi:/ To him who wants to love God, God’s Grace is more important. To him who wants God to love him, God’s Justice is more important.



* 57. My name is Grace. Who loves you most?

/Yogi:/ I love myself much. My unconditionally surrendered disciples (if I ever have any in this lifetime) will love me more. God loves me most.

/Yogi:/ What kind of injustice are you hurling at me? Do you want me always to draw the breath of my life in your brooding vice! Believe me, I have already run out of advice What now I am giving you and others is not advice, but my self-imposed futile concern.



* 59. My name is Lorraine. Although, we are your disciples, your spiritual children, it seems to me that you listen to us more than we listen to you.

/Yogi:/ Perhaps you do not know the real reason. You know, long, long ago, long before my full realisation, there was a time when God listened to me more than I listened to him, so now God is paying me back through my disciples. On achieving my highest realisation, I have really become a good boy. I always listen to Him in my life of aspiration, realisation, revelation and manifestation.



* 60. My name is Thomas. Forgive me, doubt and I are inseparable. I am sure I shall ask God for proof even when He stands right in front of me.

/Yogi:/ That is why poor God is moving heaven and earth in search of His identification card. It seems to me that He has misplaced it. No, I am wrong. Excuse me. I am now positive that God has compassionately thrown His identification card deep inside your ignorance-sea. Unfortunately, the dragon-doubt in your ignorance-sea has devoured it completely. Poor God. Since you are responsible for God losing His identification card, it will be nice, kind and generous of you not to embarrass God by asking Him for it. Next time when God comes and stands in front of you, immediately tell Him, at least for my sake, that you have revoked your charge and that you have accepted Him as your Lord Supreme, as your very own.
