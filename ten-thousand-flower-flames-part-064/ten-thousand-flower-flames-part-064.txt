#+BEGIN_VERSE

As parents disown their children
If they are extremely bad,
You can disown
The children of your mind.
But if a thought
Produced by your mind is good,
Then embrace it with a mother's love
And claim it as your own, very own.

You have done over the years,

Think of these good things,
For they have tremendous power
And can give you the strength
To overcome your inner enemies.

If you want to drag behind you
A long train with many cars,

You don't need to carry the passengers
Doubt, fear, anxiety,
Worry and frustration.

Even if a mature seeker
Is doubting his own spirituality,
Even if around him

To rediscover in himself
The divine qualities
Which he has temporarily lost.
How? Just by sincerely encouraging
The new seekers who have come after him.

Old seekers and new seekers
Have much to offer one another.
The old ones should encourage the new ones
At every moment.
Indeed, they must make sacrifice after sacrifice
For their younger brothers and sisters.
The freshness and eagerness
Of the new ones
Will give the old ones
Boundless joy and enthusiasm.
It is mutual inspiration
Founded upon true family-oneness.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

Advanced seekers are like tall trees;
Beginning seekers are like small plants.
Overnight a plant cannot become
As tall, powerful and beautiful
As the trees
That have been ascending heavenward
For many years,
With roots firmly in the ground
And branches aiming at the highest height.
The trees can give the plants inspiration
And aspiration.
The trees can give the plants protection
So they will not be blown away
By doubt, suspicion and other negative forces.
But only patience-light
Can turn the aspiration-plants
Into realisation-trees
In God's Forest.

The day you made
A sincere commitment to God
You started running along Eternity's Road
With bullet-speed.
Now you are going
At bullock-cart speed.
True, the race may be
Longer than the longest,
But that does not mean
Your inner speed has to become
Slower than the slowest.

God's supreme Message:
"Please Me in My own Way

Between your failure and God's failure.
If a flower does not blossom,
The gardener takes the blame.

In the inner world
He has taken a giant step
Closer to his Lord Supreme.
