My life is now a God-loving,
God-serving and God-pleasing song
Of my heart's
Aspiration-dream-garden.
My Lord, my Lord,
My name is now my gratitude-heart.

My Lord Supreme,
Last night You had
A most significant Dream.
In Your Dream You made me
Your most perfect and choicest instrument.
My Lord Supreme,
Last night I, too, had
A most significant dream.
In my dream I clearly saw You happy,
Unimaginably happy,
For the first time in my entire life.

My Lord Supreme,
How can I realise
Your highest Divinity
And Your transcendental Heights?
"My child,
There is only one way --
The way of love, devotion
And surrender.
You can try other ways,
But you are bound to fail.
Happiness you want?
Mine is the only Way.
Fulfilment you want?
Mine is the only Way."
