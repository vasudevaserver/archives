ABSENCE

In man's absence
My fondness-tree proudly grows.

In God's absence
My life-tree helplessly dies.

O man and God,
I tell you
My supreme secret:
Ignorance misses my absence,
Earth cherishes my absence,
Heaven terminates my absence.

WITH MUCH SWEAT

Without sweat
I acquired teeming doubts.
Without regret
I threw them away.

Without sweat
I grabbed ignorance-night.
Without regret
I killed its life.

With much sweat
I have acquired an iota of faith.
If I ever lose it
My life-boat shall sink.

With much sweat
I have discovered an iota of Light.
If I ever lose it,
I shall become a soulless creature.

To brave its sufferings.

THE UNDIVINE AND THE DIVINE

The undivine flourish,
The divine die young:
This is what we hear,
This is what we think,
This is what we know.

My soul wants to add
Something to this lofty theory:
The undivine flourish
In the closed coffin of Death.
The divine die young
In the Lap of Immortality.

By the lover's oneness,
The beloved is known.

By the wife's unhappiness,
The husband is known.

By the disciple's aspiration,
The Guru is known.

By man's perfection,
God is known.
