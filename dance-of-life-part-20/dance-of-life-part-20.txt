THE MOST DIFFICULT QUESTION

Lord, please do not mind.
Today I have
The most difficult question
For You.
If You do not know the answer,
Just tell me so.
I shall understand.
But if You know the answer,
Then You have to answer me
Most sincerely
And
With no reservations whatsoever.
Lord, here is my question:
Is the world really progressing
Or
Is the world really regressing?

"Daughter, you are most proud
Of your question
And
I am most proud
Of My answer.
Here is My answer:
The world is definitely progressing
For those who know that
I am the Creator
And
I am the Owner
Of this world,
And
The world is unthinkably regressing
For those who think that
They are the owners
And
They are the rulers
Of this world."

NEVER COMMIT SUICIDE

Lord, sweet Lord,
I do many things to please You.
Have I done anything in this life
To displease You?
"Daughter, you have."

Father, I have displeased You!
Tell me, how?
"Daughter, time and again
You have desired
To commit suicide."
Oh that, that's nothing.
Look, I am still with You
And for You on earth.

Father, is there any punishment involved
When one commits suicide?
"Daughter, punishment is a gross understatement.
My Eye of Justice
Does not forgive the coward
Who takes her life away.
My Heart of Compassion
Ignores her.
I welcome Satan
To devour her."

TWO CREATORS

Father Supreme,
I wanted to offer You
One thousand Love-Devotion-Surrender blossoms
From my heart-garden.
I am so happy that my Dream
Has seen the face of Reality.
Today.
Father Supreme,
Are You not proud of me?

"Son, My praising Capacity
Is very limited.
Therefore
Either I have to praise
My creation -
You, My son -
Or
I have to praise
Your creation -
Your poetry, your child.
Son, I hope you do not mind,
I am and I want to remain proud
Only of My own creation."
