It is a very happy day for me today, for today I have decided that I shall not continue to live with my false confidence -- my false confidence that I can destroy the world, the entire world. From today on I shall live only with real confidence. My real confidence is this: I shall serve my Beloved Supreme to transform this world into perfect Perfection -- a world that will not see the faces of insecurity and impurity, two unforgivable forces that are not allowing this beautiful world of ours to be absolutely perfect.

When insecurity captures my heart, I shall immediately declare: “Larger than the largest am I. Larger than the universe am I.” When impurity captures my life, I shall immediately declare: “I am oneness, universal oneness, within and without.”
