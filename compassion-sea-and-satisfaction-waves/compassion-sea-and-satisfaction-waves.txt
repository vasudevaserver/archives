O my impurity-vital and insincerity-mind, if you dare to abscond with my satisfaction-life, sooner than at once you will be caught by my purity-soul and sincerity-heart. My soul and heart are eager to help you. Just give them a chance. They will transform you not only radically but also unconditionally.

If you think that my happy face is a mask covering my true unhappiness, then you may be right. If you think that our Beloved Supreme’s happy Face is a mask covering His true unhappiness, then you are totally wrong.

Can you imagine, can you dare to imagine, that every day my dear Supreme, my sweet Supreme and my Beloved Supreme comes to me seven times?
The first time He comes to examine my willingness.
The second time He comes to examine my readiness.
The third time He comes to examine my newness.
The fourth time He comes to examine my oneness.
The fifth time He comes to examine my fulness.
The sixth time He comes to examine my perfection.
The seventh time He comes to examine my satisfaction.

I can say something nice to myself and I can do something good for myself only when I am completely convinced that my earth-bound desire-life has said nothing nice to me and will say nothing nice to me, has done nothing good for me and will do nothing good for me.

Either the undivine in me can conquer the divine in me, or the divine in me can conquer the undivine in me. But once I have accepted the spiritual life, the divine in me -- in the long run -- conquers the undivine in me totally, for good, forever and forever. What do we mean by the spiritual life? The spiritual life means God’s Love-Cry in man and for man and man’s gratitude-smile in God and for God.

Insecurity and impurity do not belong to me. How can I claim them? Security and purity, right from time immemorial, have been with me. How is it that I do not claim them as my own, very own?

It is a very happy day for me today, for today I have decided that I shall not continue to live with my false confidence -- my false confidence that I can destroy the world, the entire world. From today on I shall live only with real confidence. My real confidence is this: I shall serve my Beloved Supreme to transform this world into perfect Perfection -- a world that will not see the faces of insecurity and impurity, two unforgivable forces that are not allowing this beautiful world of ours to be absolutely perfect.

When insecurity captures my heart, I shall immediately declare: “Larger than the largest am I. Larger than the universe am I.” When impurity captures my life, I shall immediately declare: “I am oneness, universal oneness, within and without.”
