#+BEGIN_VERSE

If I put my Beloved Supreme
Always first in my life,
When I pray to Him
To fulfil my undivine desires,
First He delays
And then He forgets to fulfil them.
When I pray to Him
To fulfil my divine aspirations,
He not only fulfils them
Infinitely sooner than my expectation
Or even my imagination,
But He also fulfils my innocent desires
With utmost Joy.
