Today’s Peace Concert I am most devotedly dedicating to Swami Vivekananda, who conquered the heart of the World’s Parliament of Religions precisely one hundred years ago. The centenary of his address will take place in August in Chicago, and I am extremely, extremely grateful to the authorities who are organising this world conference in Chicago to commemorate the memory of Swami Vivekananda, for they have invited me to open the first session with a few minutes of silent prayer and meditation.

In silence, in deep silence, in breathless silence, I am offering my gratitude to the mighty lion-soul of Swami Vivekananda, to his Master, Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa, and also to his Mother, his Divine Mother Absolute, Mother Kali.

As you know, we have started observing Swami Vivekananda’s centenary -- not his birth centenary, but the centenary of the World’s Parliament of Religions in Chicago. It was one hundred years ago that Vivekananda became the supreme hero of the Parliament. It is my wish to offer thirty-nine Peace Concerts and dedicate them to him. He lived for thirty-nine years, and I wish to observe each year of his earthly existence by offering him, his immortal soul, a Peace Concert.

Today’s Peace Concert I am most lovingly and most devotedly offering to Swami Vivekananda. We are having the Peace Concert here at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. I am inspired to share with you the glowing tributes paid to Vivekananda by K.M. Munshi, the Founder of the Bhavan:

“Vivekananda practised in his life the twin objectives of salvation for oneself and the welfare of the world: /Atmanomokshaya/ and /Jagadhitaryacha/. He was as much concerned with the betterment of the world as with individual liberation. All the pages of his immortal writings breathe this twin purpose, justifying his reputation as the patriot-saint of India. A pioneer of Indian renaissance, he raised our religion to a pedestal of worshipful dignity.”

It is my firm inner conviction that the Chicago Conference would have been buried in oblivion long ago, as many world conferences have been, had Vivekananda not appeared from the Indian firmament to the American firmament.

The City of Chicago, in spite of the many various good qualities that it embodies, would have been known only as a city of unpredictable weather! But for Chicago to become the cynosure of all major religions would have been an impossible task.

From the spiritual point of view, let us take Chicago as the aspiring humanity’s heart-flower, and Vivekananda as the illumining Divinity’s Soul-Fragrance.

May Chicago the temple and Vivekananda the shrine inseparably and supremely inspire and guide the Religion of all religions: man, and bring down the Vision of the Transcendent God and raise the Dedication of the immanent God to transform humanity’s earth-bound cries and Divinity’s Heaven-free Smiles.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

/Uttisthata jagrata prapya varan nibodhata/
/Ksurasya dhara nisita duratyaya/
/Durgam pathas tat kavayo vadanti/

#+END_VERSE


/[A Sanskrit mantra from the Upanishads. The translation is: “Arise, awake, realise and achieve the Highest with the help of the illumining, guiding and fulfilling Masters. The path is as sharp as the edge of a razor, difficult to cross, hard to tread -- so declare the wise sages.”]/

“Arise! Awake!” -- this was Vivekananda’s choice motto.

“Arise! Awake!” -- /Uttisthata jagrata./ Each human being must needs have this message supreme imprinted on the tablet of his aspiring heart.

“Arise! Awake!” If you want to follow the path of spirituality, then you must realise that this is a difficult path to walk along. “It is as sharp as the edge of a razor.” Hard, extremely hard it is to walk along this path, but again, we have learned from the sages of the hoary past that the Knowledge supreme that we are going to attain is not for the weakling; it is for the inner hero supreme. Even the soul that is our God-representative on earth cannot be won by the weakling.

/Nayam atma bala hinena labhya/ -- “The soul cannot be won by the weakling.’’ What do we mean by this? To win the soul means to listen to the dictates of the soul. Only he who is brave can abide by the dictates of his soul. The soul is the only reality that we have and that we are. Each time we ignore the dictates of our soul either consciously or unconsciously, we indefinitely delay our spiritual progress.

You may ask, “How can we know the dictates of our soul?” You can! There is a very simple way, an easier than the easiest way: It is by virtue of your heart’s cry. If you cry and pray to your Inner Pilot, the Lord Supreme, to illumine you, to liberate you from your ignorance-cherishing mind, then the heart can easily convey the message of your soul to you.

There are many truth-seekers and God-lovers who believe in God, but who find it difficult to believe in their souls. But if you believe in the ocean, which is God, then how can you fail to believe in the countless drops, waves and surges of the ocean, which are our souls?

Unfortunately, there are some seekers who do not want to believe in the existence of their souls because they are afraid of their soul’s operation in and through them. They feel so often they are committing Himalayan blunders. If the soul does exist, then perhaps the soul is extremely displeased with them and the soul, like the human mother, the physical mother, can reprimand the naughty children. But little do the children care to know that it is the supreme task of the mother to make the children perfect.

It is the bounden duty of the soul to make our body, vital, mind and heart perfect. The soul is our inner tutor. This tutor is all eagerness to help us learn the inner language, study the inner subject and grow into the infinite effulgence of Light and Delight. We must not only believe in the existence of the soul, but we must and must abide by the dictates of the soul and most ardently aspire to please the soul.

The soul is the guide. We definitely need the guide to lead us, guide us and take us to our Goal supreme.

I am making a fervent request to all of you to dive deep within every day in order to feel the presence of your soul. To please your soul is infinitely more difficult than to please the Absolute Supreme. The Absolute Supreme has His infinite Compassion and He can wait throughout Eternity for you if you are delaying your progress. But your soul, the real reality within you, knows that the sooner you reach your Goal the better, for a new beginning, a new, illumining, more illumining and most illumining beginning is awaiting your arrival.

As I always say, today’s goal is tomorrow’s starting point. We are all seekers -- God-seekers and God-lovers. Let us have implicit faith in our soul, the God-representative within us. Let us try to abide by the dictates of our soul, for if we cannot please our primary school teacher, then we will never be able to proceed to high school, college and university.

/Remarks following the 7th Peace Concert/

Religions are fighting and fighting. But there is only one religion, which is the religion of the heart. That is what Swami Vivekananda taught us. The true religion is not a mind-made religion, but a heart-made religion. What is of paramount importance is not the many mind-invented religions, but the one heart-discovered religion.

/Remarks at the 18th Peace Concert before singing “Man chalo”/

I shall now sing an immortal song. This particular song is immortal for various reasons. When Naren, who later on became Swami Vivekananda, met with his Master, Sri Ramakrishna, for the first time, Naren sang this song. While the song was being sung, Sri Ramakrishna entered into a very, very deep trance.

Sri Ramakrishna heard the song from his beloved Naren for the first time. Later on, many, many times Naren sang this song to please his Master. This particular song in the spiritual world, in the inner world, especially in the heart of Bengal, has become immortal. It has touched the very breath, if not of the Indian, then of the Bengali heart.

Originally the mind came from the high, higher, highest Source. In this song, the first line begins, “O my mind, go back to your own highest realm, to your own Source. In this foreign world do not roam. O my mind, let us go back, you and I, to the Source.”

In India I heard this song many, many times, and it inspired me to a great extent. About six or seven years ago I heard it for the first time from the wife of Dr. Jayaraman-ji, our dearest sister Tulsi-ben. Physically she is no longer with us, but spiritually she is. She sang this song at my request, and her prayerful heart and soulful voice gave my heart tremendous delight and a divine sense of satisfaction.

Naren inspired his Master to such an extent that the Master entered into his deep, deeper, deepest trance. As you all know, my Master is my Lord Beloved Supreme, and those who are in my boat, my students, also have the same Master, our Lord Beloved Supreme. My song may not or will not or cannot inspire my Master to enter into His Trance, but I can do something else. I can most prayerfully and most devotedly place the light and delight of this song at the Feet of my Lord Beloved Supreme and I am making a special request to my students to do the same while I am singing this song.
