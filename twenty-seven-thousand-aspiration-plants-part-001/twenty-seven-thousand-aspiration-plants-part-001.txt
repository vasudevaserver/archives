Twenty-seven thousand
Aspiration-plants:
Indeed, the distance is too long.
But my Beloved Lord Supreme
Says to me,
"My child, the distance is too short.
In top secrecy I am telling you:
I shall walk with you
All the way."

I am a chosen instrument
Of my Lord Supreme
Not because I have done
Something great for Him,
Not because I shall do
Something good for Him,
But because He wants to do
Something divinely great
And supremely good
In and through me.
