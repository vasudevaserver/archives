Life and death. These are the two Blessings that I have received from God. Life inspires me to realise the highest Truth. Death wants me to wake up and hurry up.

What I can do. Although I am feebler than an insect, I dare to criticise God the Omnipotent. What I can do. Although I am His child of love, I dare to forget and ignore Him.

What I cannot do. Although I am a man, I fail to live a true human life. What I cannot do. Although I assert my own existence on earth, I do not know who I am and what I am here for.

NO speaks through my mind: "If there is a God, then how is it that I have never seen Him? No God." YES speaks through my heart: "Since there is only God, I am sure to see Him one day. Although I see Him not, I feel Him all-where." The mind sleeps while the heart aspires. The heart cries for God, while the mind doubts God and shouts at Him.

When I begged, God said: "I have nothing to do with a beggar."

When I desired, God said: "I have little to do with you. You don't want my Omnipresence, Omniscience and Omnipotence. You want to be satisfied only with an infinitesimal portion of my Reality."

When I aspired, God said: "You are my chosen child. You are my pride. You want me fully. You want my Existence, my Revelation and my Manifestation.
