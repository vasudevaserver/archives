I simply do not know how to thank You
For Your sleepless Compassion-Flood.

How to thank Me.
Just try to remain all the time
Inside your breathless receptivity-heart."

The day he became a God-seeker
Was the beginning of his conscious
Feeling of Immortality.
On that day he came to know
That he is part and parcel
Of Immortality.
On that day he realised
That he represents Immortality
On earth.
On that day he became
A pathfinder and harbinger
Of Immortality
For those on earth who will accept
The spiritual life after him.

Inside my heart-garden.
I am eagerly looking forward
To seeing my precious deer,
For I want to feel that someday
Its inner speed and beauty
Shall be mine.

My sweet Lord,
You have given my soul-bird
The capacity to fly
In the Heaven-free sky.
My mind-bird does not have
That capacity.
It is compelled to fly
In the earth-bound sky.
My sweet Lord,
Do give my mind the capacity to fly
Like my soul-bird
In the blue-vast sky
Where there is no fear,
No doubt, no death
But only the dawn
Of an ever-blossoming Immortality.

My sweet Lord,
Do tell me how I can be
Always faithful to You.
"My child,
If you want to be faithful to Me
All the time,
Then you must remain cheerful
All the time."

My sweet Lord,
How can I remain cheerful
All the time?
"My child,
You can remain cheerful
All the time
If you can only make yourself feel
That I am always pleased with you.
This is not a false belief
But the sincere awakening
Of your true life
Deep inside My Heart."

Which you may want to ask Me

How young I am.
My child,
I am as old
As your heart's inner cry
And as young
As your life's outer smile."

Do You want me to learn
The art of contemplation?

I want you to learn them one by one.
If you learn concentration-art,
Then you will be able to enter
Into the end of time.
If you learn meditation-art,
Then you will be able to bring
Right in front of you
The birthless and deathless Time.

Then you will see that you are at once
The birthless, deathless and endless Time
And the Time
Of the ever-transcending Beyond."

Do You want me
To conquer the world
Or do You want the world
To conquer me?
I shall be equally pleased
In either case.

"My child,
I do not want you either
To conquer the world
Or to be conquered by the world.
I want you to conquer
Your own outer world
And your own inner world.
Finally, I want you to conquer Me
Once and for all.
To conquer your outer world
What you need
Is a volcano-will.
To conquer your inner world
What you need
Is an aspiration-mountain.
To conquer Me
What you need
Is your soul-beauty's gratitude-heart."

O my doubting mind,
You only know how to boast.

When I vehemently argue
With the boatman of ignorance.

To protect and fulfil me.

I do not need you anymore.
O my loving heart,
You and I are for each other
Always.
