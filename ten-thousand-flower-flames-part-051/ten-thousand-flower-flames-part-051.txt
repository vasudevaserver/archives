Not once but twice will you know
The real man in a genuine seeker:
Once when you mercilessly criticise
His doubtful poison-mind -
Needless to say,
He will love you far beyond
Your imagination's flight;
Once when you unreservedly love
His fruitful nectar-heart -
Needless to say,
He will immediately admire you unreservedly
For helping him find
His long-lost vision eye.
