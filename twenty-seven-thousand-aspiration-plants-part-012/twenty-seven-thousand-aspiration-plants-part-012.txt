My life is at Your disposal.
Do mould me, shape me and guide me
In Your own Way.

Sincerity's determination-capacity
To come to You -- You alone.

A great autocrat,
Then you will eventually find yourself
On a doubt-frustration-journey.

At His choice Hour,
Then God will definitely allow you to enjoy
His Eternity's Self-Transcendence-Journey.

Your vital has walked along
Frustration-road for a long time.
Now it is completely exhausted.

Your mind has walked along
Suspicion-road for a long time.
Now it is totally exhausted.

Your heart has walked along
Illumination-road for a long time,
Yet there is no sign of its being exhausted.

Your soul has been walking along
Eternity's Liberation-Satisfaction-Road
From time immemorial,
Yet it will never become exhausted.

You are telling me that you have tried
The conventional approach to realise God.
Alas, your austerity-approach
And your sacrifice-approach
Have not liberated your earth-bound life.
Such being the case,
I am advising you to try
A long-lost conventional approach
Inside your heart.
Indeed, this is your life's
Surrender-flower-approach.

When I soulfully whispered:

Therefore He does not ignore
Small-minded human beings.
But it is also equally true
That He never intends to use them
To serve Him in any way.

When the doubting mind
Accuses the heart of insecurity,
The loving heart does not
Accuse the mind of impurity.
When the mind accuses the heart,
It immediately creates a blemish
On the heart's beauty.
When the heart does not accuse the mind,
It immediately creates a golden opportunity
For the mind's self-transcendence.

What does God see?
Only a few thorns.
God highly appreciates the rose,

If you are desperately trying

Wait and try again.
Who knows, in your next attempt
You may do extremely well.
