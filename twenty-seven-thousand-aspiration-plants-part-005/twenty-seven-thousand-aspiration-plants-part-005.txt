As beauty's dawn does not last
Longer than a few moments
In man's ugly mind,
Even so purity's evening
Does not last
More than a few fleeting seconds
In man's impure heart.

You are a spiritual failure
Not because God has
No special love for you
But because you do not want
To meet with God's Justice-Light.

When I hear
The song of your eyes,

I enter into
The world of sweetness unknowable.

How to return home
Safely, soulfully and richly.
