In the small hours of the morning,
God and I enter into
A lovely competition.
    My task is
To touch God’s Feet.
    God’s Task is
To examine my heart.
I finish my task long before God.
Poor God accepts the sad defeat.

When the night is far advanced,
God and I again enter into
Another lovely competition.
This time our task is
Mutual appreciation.
I shall have to appreciate God
As much as I can.
God will have to appreciate me
As much as He wants to.
Alas, I accept the very sad defeat.
