If God is pleased with you,
Deliberately He may not fulfil
All your desires.
If He is extremely pleased with you,
Then He may fulfil
Some of your innocent desires.
But if He is completely pleased with you,
Then He is not going to satisfy
Even one earthbound desire of yours,
For He wants you to be a co-sharer
Of His Infinity's free Delight.
