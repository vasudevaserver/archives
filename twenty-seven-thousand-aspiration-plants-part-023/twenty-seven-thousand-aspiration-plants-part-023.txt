As His finished product,
But He considers each human heart
As His unfinished product.

No matter how developed

In your spiritual life,

How to realise Him.
Your turn is coming.
You have to show Him
How you are going
To manifest Him.

I sing my prayer-song
At my Lord's Feet.
Every evening
I dance my meditation-dance
Inside the Heart-Garden
Of my Lord Supreme.

If God is pleased with you,
Deliberately He may not fulfil
All your desires.
If He is extremely pleased with you,
Then He may fulfil
Some of your innocent desires.
But if He is completely pleased with you,
Then He is not going to satisfy
Even one earthbound desire of yours,
For He wants you to be a co-sharer
Of His Infinity's free Delight.
