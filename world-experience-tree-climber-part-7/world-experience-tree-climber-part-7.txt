At the television studio in Germany, they put a little transmitter inside my ear so that I could get a simultaneous English translation of what the interviewer was saying.

It was very confusing because I could hear the interviewer talking in German, and at the same moment I was hearing the English translation.

So in one ear I was hearing German and in the other ear I was trying to listen to English. The English and German were coming together-one word from this side and one word from that side.

It was very difficult to understand!

At the start of the television interview, they showed a video of the 100-metre dash in the Olympics, when Ben Johnson defeated Carl Lewis. But Carl Lewis was eventually declared the winner because Ben Johnson was disqualified. The announcer said Carl Lewis wins races because he prays and meditates. He said he was now going to introduce the man behind Carl Lewis' prayer and meditation. It was a very significant introduction.

Then they opened the side door where I had been waiting and I came out. On the television screen there was the title, "Carl Lewis' mental trainer," but I didn't see it. The disciples told me about it afterwards.

I had so many problems with the English translator. At one point the interviewer asked how I help Carl Lewis with his prayer and meditation, but the translator said, "Now tell us something about how you help Ben Johnson with his prayer and meditation."

At another point when I said "pray and meditate," the translator said "play and meditate" in German. Kailash told me afterwards.

Early in the morning I wanted to change some money at the hotel. There was only one person ahead of me in line, but it took me twenty minutes to get my money changed because that person and the man behind the desk were talking and talking.

At seven o'clock in the morning Ekantar did me a favour. Before I came down to the lobby, he paid my bill. Then immediately they turned off my telephone so that I could not make any more outside calls.

When I told the operator that I wanted to make a phone call, she said, "No, no, your room bill has already been paid. You can't make any more phone calls."

I said, "But I am still here in the room. I will come down and pay again."

After a long fight, they finally agreed.

When I arrived at the Athens airport, I showed them my Greek visa, which was on page four of my passport. But they had to examine all the other pages as well. Then they asked me why I went to so many places.

Next they said, "How much money do you have? You have to show us."

My bag with most of my money was with Projjwal, so I simply emptied both of my pockets. Inside was all German currency.

They said, "Why do you have German money?"

I said, "Look at my ticket. I am coming from Munich."

They said, "No, you have to have American dollars!"

Then they called up another officer. Such a waste of time! For about half an hour they were harassing me.

When I was in Athens I saw Yiannis Kouros and his family. His wife Teresa is so sweet and polite. Their daughter Veronica acted as if she had known me all her life. They have put so many pictures of me in her room!

At the concert in Athens, Yiannis introduced me and gave a long talk about our philosophy. Then he and his family came with us to eat after the concert.

I brought little toys for Veronica. Luckily, I had bought two frogs -- one for somebody whom I know was a frog in her last animal incarnation, and the other for Veronica. When the frog was turned on, it started jumping. She was so delighted. She was sitting on her chair, but then she jumped up to get her jumping frog!

In Athens I was invited to visit a meditation club that follows all the spiritual Masters, including Ramakrishna and Satya Sai Baba. They liked my meditation book and have translated an abridged version.

They sang bhajans and asked me quite a few questions. At one point they were singing "Ganesha" in various ways, but I couldn't understand what they were saying.

I asked, "What were you singing?"

They said, "You don't know? This is about your God Ganesha."

Then I told them a few stories about Ganesha and they were very happy. Finally they sang one of my Bengali songs, "Usha bala elo." Suhriday and Nikunja had taught them.

Then she saw me standing there and was so surprised!

Like a magnet I was pulling her towards me, but she didn't see me at all.

I was coming home on the Concorde. The man who gave me my ticket said it was leaving from Gate 10 at seven o'clock.

Before seven o'clock they made the announcement: "British Airways bound for New York is now boarding at Gate 10." So I went there and gave the lady at the gate my ticket. As usual, she tore off a portion and gave the other portion to me. Then I entered into the plane.

When I got inside, the man checking tickets said, "Wrong plane!"

I said, "How could it be the wrong plane? The man at the ticket counter told me to come to Gate 10, and the lady at the door took my ticket."

He said, "No, you are supposed to go on the Concorde, and this is a regular plane."

I went back to the lady at the gate and said, "Why did you send me into this plane?"

Then she started barking at me, saying, "Who asked you to go there?"

I said, "I gave you the ticket. What do I know about it? If it was not the right plane, you should have told me!"

Then an officer came and scolded her because it was her fault. He told me the correct gate to go to.

My plane was supposed to have left at seven o'clock, but it had been delayed. After that I had to wait several more hours for my flight. The Concorde is supposed to save time, so this is how I saved time!

When I was finally on the plane, a man fatter than the fattest came up to me and said, "Can I see your ticket?"

I said, "Yes."

He said, "I have to see whether you are Charlie or David."

\`C' and \`D' he wouldn't say, only Charlie and David! My ticket happened to be 11C- Charlie. That was the aisle seat.

He asked, "Do you mind if I change with you? My seat is David."

I answered, "No, it is fine."

Unfortunately, the Concorde seats are very, very narrow, and he couldn't fit into the seat. His thighs went very nicely into the space where I was sitting, although I was trying desperately to squeeze myself against the window. How much I suffered!

He was very, very nice, but so fat! Although the Concorde is very expensive-even more than first class-the seats are very small. The Concorde is only for those who are in a tremendous hurry. But if the flight is delayed, it is really useless.

On my flight to Puerto Rico, an elderly man from Canada was sitting beside me. He said he had ordered a vegetarian meal, but the stewardess said that they had no record of this.

He said, "No, I confirmed it. It was registered on the computer." He was mad, mad, mad. So they had a fight.

Finally, after fifteen minutes the stewardess said, "We made a mistake. Your name was found. Unfortunately, we don't have even one vegetarian dish."

Then the head steward came and said, "We found your vegetarian meal."

But when they gave him his food, it was not vegetarian. There was no difference between his food and everybody else's. He was old but very smart, so he knew that it was the same meal.

Then he said to me, "My wife fell down in Miami Beach. Now she is in the hospital paralysed. I have only one son, but I do not know where he is. This is my fate!"

I deeply sympathised with him.

While flying back from Puerto Rico, I was sitting near the window. When they started showing the movie, the stewardess came and pulled down the window shade.

The lady sitting next to me on the aisle did not want to watch the movie. She was interested in Time magazine, so she lifted up the shade so that she could see better. Her reading light was on, but she wanted daylight as well.

Twice the stewardess came and pulled the shade down. But each time the lady reached over me and pulled the shade back up.

I watched this happen twice. Then I didn't want to see it anymore, so I went to sleep.

Coming back from Seattle, I was flying first class. But even that didn't save me!

First of all, after I sat down in my proper seat, they wanted me to move because they had given the same seat number to another passenger. They said, "You have to move because your seat number was issued in New York."

Finally, when I insisted, they took the other person's ticket and changed it.

Then, in two cases they had separated husband and wife. A man was seated next to me, but his wife was three rows behind. She came over to me and said, "Would you change seats with me?"

I went to her seat right away. Then, when the plane was about to start, another man came up to me and said, "Please, this is my wife here. Could I sit with her?"

So I changed seats again. This was my first-class experience!

During the flight, the stewardess came over to me and asked, "Do you want cereal or sausage?"

I said, "Cereal." Then I started meditating and entered into a high consciousness.

They put some yogurt in front of me, but also ham. When I saw the ham, I said, "Great!"

I thought I would just eat the yogurt and cereal. I started to pour some milk on my cereal, but the milk immediately jumped up and spilled on my trousers. The cereal dish was covered with plastic, but I did not notice it.

A bearded man sitting near me saw what happened and said, "Are you a philosopher? I think you are a philosopher." Then he added, "I am, too!"

I looked through the viewing hole in the door and saw that she had only a white towel around her. So I didn't open the door. She was saying, "I need sleep, I need sleep!"

I said, "Sorry, sorry, sorry!"

I was playing the cello, not the saxophone, but she couldn't sleep.

Five or six years ago when I was playing the cello in my hotel room, a man came to my door and said, "You play well, but my daughter is sick, so I am asking you to stop."

At the Holiday Inn in Kuching, Borneo, there was an Indian restaurant. When I went there, they did not want to let me in because I was uncivilised-wearing shorts.

I said, "I am an Indian. You won't allow me in?"

The girl said, "Let me go and speak to the boss."

The boss said, "All right, as long as you aren't wearing sandals." Fortunately, I was wearing my running shoes.

Then I showed the girl what I wanted on the menu. Half an hour later the food still had not come. When I asked the girl what was going on, she said, "You have not ordered." She had forgotten!

I got mad at her and the boss scolded her. Then she came to me for consolation. I said that I forget things every day and told her that I was not angry.

The poor girl had been working there for only two weeks. She was so happy that I had forgiven her.

The Sultan also felt something in me. He was so kind and affectionate from beginning to end. He showed me the same kind of affection that Dan Lurie, the physical fitness proponent, shows me.

In the newspaper he had seen the picture of my lifting Samy Vellu. So when he saw me, he immediately said, "Do you want to lift me?" Of course I did! The whole time I was lifting him, he was in a trance; he was so happy.

I put away my ballpoint and pretended I had to go to the bathroom. For more than ten minutes I stood near the bathroom door. Finally I went back to my seat, but the fight was still going on!

He said, "You do not know? There are four castes, and I come from the Brahmin caste. So Brahmins can have the name Normand."

I said, "Although I am not a Brahmin, I know the Indian caste system well. I have read the scriptures and there is no such surname."

* The Shameless Bargainer

The lady in one store in Bali was a perfect rogue. I wanted to buy something, but she quoted a price which was very high-30,000 rp. I said to her, "7,000."

She looked at me very nicely and said, "All right, 19,000-no less."

I said, "I won't pay 19,000. I will give you 8,000."

Then she said, "17,000." I took one step backwards and she said, "15,000."

I said, "No, 8,000 is enough!" and I started walking away. After I took seven or eight steps, she called out, "14,000!"

I said, "I am not going to come to your price."

Finally she said, "All right, all right- 8,000!"

In my mind I had been willing to go up to 10,000, but she accepted 8,000. So from 30,000 I shamelessly brought her down to

8,000. If they ask for 30,000, who else would dare to say 8,000?

It is so difficult to drive in Bali. The dogs create such problems. If you want to save their lives, you have to give your own life! So many times they almost caused us accidents!

A man selling flowers said that three marigolds cost 100 rp. So I gave him 100 rp. and put three marigolds in the bag. Then I put two more in. I kept adding marigolds until I had eight. The man didn't mind, so I got eight for the price of three!

When I was walking along the beach in Bali, I could not walk properly because of my knee pain. Not only young girls but also elderly people were giggling and laughing at me. I asked myself, "Where has sympathy gone?"

Yesterday's doctor tortured me like anything when he was giving me a massage. At one point he was biting my left toe with his teeth. He was biting down so powerfully that I had to scream so he would stop. And today I have such pain there-as though I had been stung by a bee.

He said that for one month he has been drinking only water. He said it is what God told him to do when he went to the mountains. He does not charge for his services, but you can leave a love offering on the shrine.

Today's massage was not as brutal as the one I got yesterday. The doctor was saying, "Wherever it is hot, it is good. Wherever it is cold, it is bad."

Then the funniest thing happened. He said, "Now you are better," but I couldn't walk!
