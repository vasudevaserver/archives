The outer weather challenges us;
The inner weather frightens us.
But our Lord’s infinite Compassion,
Affection, Love and Concern
Enable us to silence and smash
Their pride and torture.

Those who love God happily,
Cheerfully, self-givingly, unconditionally,
Sleeplessly and breathlessly
Will never, never, never believe
In God’s defeat-failures.
To them, every moment is God’s Victory,
God’s Supreme Victory,
Even though at times
Our wee human mind
Cannot understand the significance
Of God’s constant Victory,
Victory Transcendental
And Victory Universal.

My Lord Supreme, I am praying to You
To bless all the marathon runners
With Your sweet and fond Marathon-Love.
My Lord, they desperately need
    Your Compassion.
My Lord, I am also praying to You
To bless our self-giving organisers.
Self-giving is the right word, my Lord.
They always serve You lovingly
   And self-givingly,
And at times sleeplessly.
My Lord, I am also praying to You
To bless profusely the helpers
And also the well-wishers
    Of this marathon.
May all the runners run
    Smilingly and happily
While covering the entire distance.

The outer run has a destination.
The inner run knows no destination.
The inner run is a run of the Beyond,
For the ever-transcending Beyond.
The outer run asks me who I was.
My answer: I was a God-dreamer.
The inner run asks me who I am.
My answer: I am a God-lover.
Finally, God asks me who I would like to be.
My answer: My Lord, I would like to be
Your Eternity’s server-slave.
My Lord says, “No, not correct!
I would like you to be the co-pilot
Of My Eternity’s Golden Boat-Journey.”

/These prayers were mostly offered by Sri Chinmoy at the conclusion of the weekly Saturday morning “Runners are smilers two-mile races” held in New York. In 2002 Sri Chinmoy renamed them “Self-Transcendence Races.” During Christmas trips to other countries, additional races are held on other days of the week over shorter or longer distances. Sri Chinmoy frequently participated in these races./
