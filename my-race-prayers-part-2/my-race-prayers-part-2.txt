The outer weather challenges us;
The inner weather frightens us.
But our Lord’s infinite Compassion,
Affection, Love and Concern
Enable us to silence and smash
Their pride and torture.

Each time an unconditionally

Meets with God,
God tells him,
“My child, you are the beauty
Of My Soul’s
Transcendental Dream
And you are the duty
Of My Heart’s
Universal Reality.”

My Supreme,
My Lord Supreme,

My heart, my life and I
Wish to learn only two things from You:
Do teach us how to cry for You,
Only for You,
And how to surrender ourselves
Entirely and completely to You,

Those who love God happily,
Cheerfully, self-givingly, unconditionally,
Sleeplessly and breathlessly
Will never, never, never believe
In God’s defeat-failures.
To them, every moment is God’s Victory,
God’s Supreme Victory,
Even though at times
Our wee human mind
Cannot understand the significance
Of God’s constant Victory,
Victory Transcendental
And Victory Universal.

Finally, God asks me who I would like to be.
My answer: My Lord, I would like to be
Your Eternity’s server-slave.
My Lord says, “No, not correct!
I would like you to be the co-pilot
Of My Eternity’s Golden Boat-Journey.”

My Lord, please forgive me.
Today I do not have any special prayer
To place at Your Feet.

“My child, tomorrow you must pray to Me
More than usual.”

My Lord, today I am unable to think of You.

“My child, tomorrow you must think of Me
Much more than usual.”

My Lord, today I am unable to love You.

“My child,
Tomorrow you must and must and must
Love Me infinitely more
Than you usually do.
My child, today I am forgiving you,
But you must not be negligent
In your prayers.
You must not be negligent
In thinking of Me.
You must not be negligent
In loving Me.
If you want to claim Me to be yours
And if I want to claim you to be Mine,
Then you must never, never, never
Forget your morning spiritual
Love-devotion-surrender-disciplines.”

/These prayers were mostly offered by Sri Chinmoy at the conclusion of the weekly Saturday morning “Runners are smilers two-mile Races” held in New York. In 2002 Sri Chinmoy renamed them “Self-Transcendence Races.” During Christmas trips to other countries, additional races are held on other days of the week over shorter or longer distances. Sri Chinmoy frequently participated in these races./
