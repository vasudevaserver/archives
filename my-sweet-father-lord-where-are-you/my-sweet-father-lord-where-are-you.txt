Absurd, My child, absurd!
The entire creation, the entire universe,
Is created by Me.
I am the body
And
I am the Spirit of the universe.
My child, I am most affectionately,
Most blessingfully inviting you
To come and live with Me
In My Heart-Nest.
Come, My child, come!
Come play with Me and sing with Me.
Lo, My child,
Perfect is your love for Me,
Perfect is your devotion to Me,
Perfect is your surrender to Me.
Your name is now perfect perfection-sky,
And
My Name is perfect Satisfaction-Sun.
My child, to make the Real in you happy,
Today, tomorrow and forever and forever
I must love you in My divine Way,
The only Way.
My child, My child, My child!"

When I see my Master's sorrowful eyes,
I cry, I cry and I cry.

When I touch my Master's sorrowful heart,
I sigh, I sigh and I sigh.

When I feel my Master's sorrowful life,
I die, I die and I die.

When I see my Master's God-smiling eyes,
My God-realisation-hope blooms.

When I touch my Master's God-smiling heart,
My God-realisation-promise blossoms.

When I feel my Master's God-smiling life,
My God-realisation-dream-manifested reality
Feeds the God-hungry seekers of God's Universe.

My Lord, My Lord, My Lord,
This morning do You have
Any special Blessing-Message for me?
"My child, I do.
My child, every day,
In the small hours of the morning,
You must wake up.
Then immediately
You must wake up your child, aspiration.
Then immediately
You and your child, aspiration,
Must open your heart-door to My Hope.
Then immediately
I shall open My Heart-Door
To your promise.
Then immediately
Give Me the beauty
Of your heart's tears
And the fragrance
Of your soul's smiles.
I shall then immediately
Give you the Beauty
Of My Heart's Universal Dream
And the Fragrance
Of My Soul's Transcendental Reality."

The higher you think of Me,
The longer you think of Me
And
The deeper you think of Me,
The sweeter will be your heart,
The purer will be your mind
And
The easier will be your self-giving to Me.

In the very near future
When you will come to realise
Who you truly are:
You are the Beauty of My Dream,
You are the Fragrance of My Reality."

My Lord, if You can make me

Only for five minutes every day,

My child, if you can please Me,
I shall make you and keep you happy,
Not only for an hour every day
But for the entire day."
My Lord, I want to make You happy,
But please show me the way.

For five minutes every day.

Throughout the entire day.
Just show Me the way."

My dear God, my dearer God, my dearest God,
My sweet Lord, my sweeter Lord,
My sweetest Lord,
At my journey's start You blessed me
Most compassionately and most affectionately
With quite a few divine qualities.
My life's God, my heart's Lord,
In the future if once more I displease You,
Then You may take away
All the divine qualities
Save and except one:
Please, please, please keep with me
My obedience-heart
To breathe prayerfully, happily
And gloriously
In my mind, in my vital and in my body.
My life's God, my heart's Lord,
This morning my soul, that represents You
Divinely, supremely and eternally,
In soundless sound has told me
That if I continue displeasing You,
Either consciously or even unconsciously,
Then mine will be the life
Of utter failure-tears
At the end of my journey's close.
My life's God, my heart's Lord,
May my outer life of dedication
Become Your absolute Commander-Will-
Obedience-perfection.
May my inner heart of aspiration
Become Your absolute Commander-Will-
Obedience-satisfaction.

The dust-beauty, the dust-fragrance
And the dust-delight
