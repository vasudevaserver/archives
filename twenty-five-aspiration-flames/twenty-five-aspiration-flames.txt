#+BEGIN_VERSE

Let us pray to God to grant us the capacity,
Out of His infinite Bounty,
To sleeplessly serve
the peace-aspiring world.
Let us pray to God
To give us the most beautiful face
Of a oneness-world-family.
Let us pray to God
To give us the most powerful heart
Of a oneness-world-home.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

A long twenty-three years ago my Beloved Supreme Absolute brought me to America to be of most soulful service to Him in the West. He blessed me with His infinite Hope, infinite Inspiration and infinite Aspiration to serve Him in the West.
You are my sweet children. You are my service-plants. You will one day become huge banyan trees. I am not only helping you; I will make you realise the Absolute Supreme and I will manifest Him in and through you at His choice Hour.
You are my choice children. With you and in you I see the perfection of humanity's heart and life. Love the Supreme in me infinitely more. Be devoted to the Supreme in me infinitely more. Lo, yours will be the sleepless joy and breathless satisfaction. Yours will be the complete perfection that humanity has been longing for centuries and centuries.

Inside your Inner Pilot for His sleepless,
Birthless and deathless Satisfaction
In you and through you.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

My Lord Beloved Supreme,
It is now so clear to me that
You do not care for me.
My Lord, You do not care for me.
Is it because my mind is insincere?
Is it because my heart is impure?
Is it because I criticise You
Inwardly and outwardly every day?
Or are there some other reasons
Why You do not care for me?


"My child, if it is true that
I do not care for you,
Then it is not because of
your mind's insincerity,
Not because of your heart's impurity,
Not because of your cruel criticism of Me,
But because you dare to live
And do succeed in living
Without My Heart's Compassion,
Love, Blessing and Light."

#+BEGIN_VERSE

My mind tells me that my heart
Is not a sincere God-lover.
My heart tells me that my mind
Can never be transformed
And will never be transformed.
But my Lord Supreme is secretly telling me
That both my mind and my heart
Are totally mistaken.
He is telling me that my heart
Is definitely a sincere God-lover,
And that my mind will before long
Be transformed-
Amazingly transformed
And unimaginably transformed.

Of your newly-acquired
blue-gold child-friend.
You will regain your love for Me."
