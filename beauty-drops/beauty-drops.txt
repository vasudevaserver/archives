/During a meditation at the United Nations on 4 April 1975, Sri Chinmoy invited members of the United Nations Meditation Group to give him spiritual words (poem 1 to 22)./

/Four days later, during a meeting in Queens on 8 April 1975, Sri Chinmoy again invited spiritual words, this time from his disciples (poem 23 to 50)./

/As each word was offered, he spontaneously created a poem based on that word./

  :KEYWORDS:
  :CITE-KEY: BD:3

#+BEGIN_VERSE

Human love
Tells the world
What it can do for the world,
Although
It does not do it.

Divine love
Tells the world
That it is crying to be accepted
As a real friend
By the world of suffering,
The world of misunderstanding
And
The world of constant miseries,
Frustrations, trials and tribulations.
Love divine
Is begging this world of ours
Only to be accepted
So that it may then serve the world.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

Willpower
Is the light of the soul.
This light of the soul
Does not expose
The darkness of millennia
Which we embody.
On the contrary,
This light of the soul
Illumines the ignorance-night
That has captured us
And wants to strangle us.
This light frees us,
This light liberates us
From ignorance-night
    And
Then illumines the ignorance-night
That had enveloped us.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

Oneness with the physical world
Teaches us
How to divide,
How to separate,
How to limit
    And
How to bind;
It teaches us
How to destroy the thing
That we feel is real in us,
Which is love.

Oneness with the spiritual world
And spiritual life
Shows us
How to give,
How to serve,
How to grow into
    And
How to become a divine being,
The Being Supreme
Who embodies the Love of the
World Beyond.

You see only through constant self-giving
To the Source within you.

Eternally?
He dares to live eternally
Just because He knows
The supreme secret:
The secret-life of humour.

If God on earth
And
God in Heaven
Failed to enjoy
The life-breath of humour,
By this time,
God would have greatly suffered.
The human in God
Would have died long ago
From earth's mental sickness.
The divine in God
Would have given up
His divinity in Heaven
Because of Heaven's conscious indifference
To earth's excruciating pangs.

God will live eternally
Just because
He enjoys snow-white humour.
In snow-white humour
He shakes off His earthly headaches
And
His Heavenly frustrations.

On earth,
Closeness is nothing
But physical proximity.

In Heaven,
Closeness is nothing
But the soul's oneness,
Conscious oneness.

In God,
Closeness is nothing
But the song of His Self-amorous,
Self-fulfilling Immortality.

Human closeness is
Our conscious self-giving of the "I"
Which tells us that God is for others
    Or
That God cannot be achieved.
But
God is forever and forever
For the seeker,
Who is an instrument of His.

If the seeker
Feels that God is eternally
For the seeker,
Only for the seeker,
Closeness on earth
Will not remain a far cry,
But will become the living breath
Of consciousness-reality
In the seeker's aspiration-life.
