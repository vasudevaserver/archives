#+BEGIN_VERSE

My Lord,
I am seriously angry with You.
I do not need Your Power.
“What else, My child?”
I do not need Your Love.
“What else, My child?”
I do not need Your Compassion.

“What else, My child?”
I do not need Your Attention.
“What else, My child?”
My Lord,
Truth to tell,
I do not need anything from You.

“My child,
Is your exceptionally powerful sermon over?” Yes, my Lord.
“My child,
My pithy Sermon begins.
Just because you do not need anything
From Me,
That does not mean
That I am not entitled
To have anything from you.

In no way you can prevent Me
From desiring things from you.
I need your affection.
I need your sweetness.
I need your fondness.”
My Lord,
As I do not need anything from You,
Even so, You have to be fully prepared
To live
All by Yourself.

“My child,
You are My Eternity’s Heart.
You are My Immortality’s Breath.
You want to play the role
Of your volcano-anger.
I want to play the role
Of My Forgiveness-Fountain.”

Why are you so ungrateful?

That I have put My Arm around you?
Can you not see
That with My Vision-Eye-Wings
I am sheltering you?

Can you not see and feel
That you are the sole object
Of My very, very special Concern?
My Concern for you
Shall remain forever unparalleled.

My child,
If you continue to displease Me,
Then I shall compel you
To take human incarnations
Countless times.
Needless to say,
This will be My last resort.”

Between the success-shore
And the progress-shore.

With My
