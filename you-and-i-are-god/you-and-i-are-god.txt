When the answer does not seem to come,
Do not give up.

Break your face with your illumining smiles.

Why doesn't God stop wars?
Because
The animal in us enjoys war.
Why doesn't God stop wars?
Because
The human in us is afraid of enjoying
The company of its totally unfamiliar friend:
Peace.
Such being the case,
Do we not deserve to be
Strangled and slaughtered
By one another?
Yes, we certainly do.

I had a bitter quarrel with God. Many a time He has come to make up, but my ire has not allowed me to be on good terms with Him. To Him I have said, "God, you have made me the man in the moon, but I wish to be a man of the earth." No answer have I heard from Him.

At last I now comprehend the meaning of His Silence. When evil things torture me, I must in no time become the man in the moon. And when ignorance rises to dominate me, forthwith I must be a man of the earth.

Our heart is ingenuous. Our mind is ingenious. Our body is ignorant. Our eyes are infants. Our vital is a roaring tiger. Our soul is an orphan. With its birth, its parents have thrown it down to earth from the pinnacled sphere to found the Life Divine upon the clay with the assistance of the heart, mind, vital, body and senses.

Alas, except for the heart, all the members of our family look down upon the soul and say, "O fool and beggar, away you go to your own clime! No need have we of you. We are quite content with this sweet earth of ours." Alas, the true ruler is ruled by its eyeless pigmy subjects.

Tears flow down our cheeks when our dear ones are gathered to our fathers. But we forget the truth that our fathers, too, had to suffer much when their dear ones were in the land of the living.

What is death after all? It is but one shore of the sea of Consciousness. The other shore is life. The sole work of life is to sow and the sole work of death is to reap. Both are interdependent.

How to serve a man most effectively? With money? Not sufficient. With joy? Not sufficient. With any other belonging of the earth? Not sufficient.

There are two fruits: one silence, the other din. The wise pine for the former; the ignorant long for the latter. Those who dwell in silence say that the world is not a dream; it is a self-assertive reality. Those who are devoured by din say that the world is more transitory than a rope of sand. Both parties are adamant in their assertions.

A terrible dispute arose between my heart and my mind over who was right. According to my heart, silence is far superior to din. According to my mind, silence is no match for din. They made me the judge. As I was ignorant of the truth, I went to my soul with a tremulous tongue.

My soul consoled me and said, "Your heart is the pinnacle of wisdom and your mind is the abyss of ignorance. I give you two seeds. One is Immortality, the other is transformation. Sow the first seed in your heart and the second in your mind. In no time, you will find that their terrible fight will end in a fond embrace."

Alas! My soul has been stolen away. Desire, the thief, is in collusion with my mind. In vain I thrashed them soundly, but the more I beat them the louder became their laughter.

O Lord and God, my power is ignorance; Yours is Knowledge. I have fought with You many a time and every time I have come off second best.
