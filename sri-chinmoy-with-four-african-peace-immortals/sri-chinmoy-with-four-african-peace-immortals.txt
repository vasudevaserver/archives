ARCHBISHOP DESMOND TUTU: A SOUL-DIAMOND,A HEART-DIAMOND

Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Desmond!
A soul-diamond, a heart-diamond.
Archbishop Peace-Dreamer, Archbishop!
Your code of life: stop violence, stop!
O wisdom-fountain, justice-mountain,
In you, with you no ignorance-chain.
Africa's life-story, heart-song
The whole world hears from your vision-gong.

/Sri Chinmoy introduced the presentation of the U Thant Peace Award to Archbishop Tutu with the following remarks:/

It is a great privilege for me and for the members of Sri Chinmoy: The Peace Meditation at the United Nations to be in the presence of a revered messenger of peace such as you, Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Father Tutu, your life of unswerving faith represents the enduring love of the Divine for your cherished country-a land richly blessed by the Creator yet, for so long, torn by the strife of separation. Throughout long decades of struggle, yours was the eloquent voice of unity, of reconciliation, of tolerance, of patience, of forgiveness, of conviction. At the same time, it was a compelling call to action. Finally, your voice proclaimed the destined victory of justice, peace and oneness.

Father Tutu, according to me, you are a soul-diamond, a heart-diamond. We know that diamonds are formed by intense pressure. During the years of your ministry, you experienced and expressed all the excruciating sufferings of the black people of South Africa. At the same time, as a chosen instrument of God, you courageously, devotedly and tirelessly fought against the appalling ignorance of apartheid, while praying for the transformation of its perpetrators. Placed by the Hand of God between the unstoppable freedom-surge of the oppressed and the fearful aggression-retaliation of the oppressor, you emerged as the brilliant diamond of unity, reflecting the Oneness-Light of the Creator. In you, all the rainbow-colours of God's children find their true home.

Father Tutu, you perfectly embody both contemplation and action, and thus you serve as a radiant example for God-lovers and peace-seekers everywhere in today's world. In your compelling words: "The most important, the most cardinal fact about our life is the spiritual-that encounter with God in prayer, in worship, in meditation." Far from providing an escape, religion for you sounds a clarion call to the service of truth. Once again, in your words: "There is nothing the government can do to me that will stop me from being involved in what I believe is what God wants me to do."

Father Tutu, your illumined wisdom proclaims that separation is the greatest suffering and the root of conflict, whereas oneness is the greatest joy and the wellspring of peace. Your heart of faith, your life of humility toward God and man-which is nothing but oneness itself, your towering intellect surrendered to the service of God, and your eloquent voice of all-embracing love make you a shining harbinger of tomorrow's peace-flooded oneness-world. Today, therefore, we wish to present to you our U Thant Peace Award.

/Sri Chinmoy then read the inscription on the Award:/

The U Thant Peace Award is presented to Archbishop Desmond Tutu:

- devoted messenger of the divine unity of the Creator's rainbow-children;
- eloquent voice of humanity's suffering and Divinity's Compassion;
-  harbinger of the spirituality of transformation; sowing the seeds of Heaven's oneness-love in earth's division-mind;
-  offering the flower-victory at the Feet of the Supreme Father.

admiration and gratitude, \\

/Archbishop Tutu graciously accepted the award and then invited Sri Chinmoy and the choir inside for a reception, shaking the singers' hands as he greeted them. During the reception, a video was shown of the late Secretary-General U Thant offering remarks as guest of honour at the staging of Sri Chinmoy's play about the life of the Buddha. At the end of the reception, the Archbishop thanked Sri Chinmoy with the following remarks./

/Archbishop Tutu:/ Thank you very, very much. On behalf of all of us, we are enormously grateful that you have taken the time to come here to spread this message of love and harmony and peace.Thank you for honouring me and honouring us here. You have come with wonderful timing, because I have just recently been appointed to chair the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which we all hope is going to assist our country in the process of healing all the trauma that has been caused by apartheid's injustice in the past. We hope that you and your disciples and followers will uphold us in your prayers as we set out on this momentous journey in our country. Thank you very much for all your work.

/Sri Chinmoy (presenting two of his books,/ A Garland of Nation-Souls /and/ My Meditation-Service at the United Nations)/:/ May I offer you these books? These are the talks that I have given at the United Nations over the years, and these are the questions I have answered that have been asked by United Nations delegates and staff.

May we now congratulate you with our prayers. We have a special song, and we sing this prayerful song while congratulating somebody.

/The choir performed the "Congratulation" song./

/Archbishop Tutu:/ Thank you very, very much. God bless you, God bless you.

/Archbishop Tutu then asked Sri Chinmoy to sign his official guest book. Sri Chinmoy wrote the following inscription:/

/The Archbishop walked Sri Chinmoy to his car with great kindness and affection./

/Later Sri Chinmoy made the following comment about Archbishop Tutu:/ He has many, many divine qualities, but the most important one is his justice. With justice-light he starts. Then comes his compassion-height aspect, and finally his forgiveness-delight.

First Prime Minister of Zimbabwe (1980-88) \\
President of Zimbabwe (since 1988)

/On 1 January 1996, President Robert Mugabe received Sri Chinmoy at the State House in Harare. President Mugabe first welcomed Sri Chinmoy and several assistants into his private chambers./

/President Mugabe:/ Greetings! Please come in.

/Sri Chinmoy:/ Beloved President, Supreme Pilot of Zimbabwe, I am extremely, extremely grateful to you for kindly allowing me to be in your blessingful presence.

/President Mugabe:/ It is a pleasure for me to receive you. May I offer you best wishes for the New Year and say how happy we are to have you here in Zimbabwe.

/Sri Chinmoy:/ This morning, beloved President, read in /The Herald,/ the daily newspaper, that you said you take pride in the unity, the better education and the better health of your countrymen. I am sure that your countrymen also are extremely grateful to you for all these blessings. The unity, better education and better health among your countrymen are largely due to your inspiration, determination and dedication.

/President Mugabe:/ Thank you. We have been trying our best to bring about peace. The struggle we waged was the struggle for a better environment: more peaceful, more democratic, more accommodating; and those are the principles we are still cherishing to this day. We want harmony, not just in Zimbabwe, but in our region as well, and internationally. We are happy to hear that you have been trying to promote peace throughout the world, making your own spiritual contribution, just as the United Nations makes its political and social contributions. I am sure the impact of the totality of all our efforts is bearing fruit. Just now everybody is talking about the end of the Cold War and a better international environment, although we have areas which still have trouble, problems, where fighting still occurs, but I think that generally the world is progressing.

/Sri Chinmoy:/ Yes, efforts towards peace should be made in every possible way. /(Presenting the music of his song dedicated to the President)/ This is my prayerful song about you, Sir.

/President Mugabe:/ It is in staff notation already.

/Sri Chinmoy:/ I was also deeply inspired by your momentous utterances, and I have set these to music.

/President Mugabe:/ Wonderful! Who is a poet here?

/Sri Chinmoy (presenting The Garland of Nation-Souls):/ May I offer this to you? I have been giving talks at the United Nations for the past 25 years. Every Tuesday and Friday I go there to pray and meditate. These are the talks that I have given over the years.

/President Mugabe:/ Thank you.

/Sri Chinmoy:/ I am so grateful that you have kindly agreed to accept our U Thant Peace Award. This award has been accepted by many other men and women of peace. President Gorbachev and Mother Teresa are among those who have previously received this award. You are a true man of peace. You have made great sacrifices for your country. You are one with the heart, the soul and the life of your country. I am sure that God the Almighty will give you more opportunities to bring unity, higher education and greater health to your countrymen and in every way to improve the inner and outer environment of your country. You are a supremely chosen instrument of His and you have played your role beautifully and successfully.

/President Mugabe and Sri Chinmoy then moved to another room where a choir of Sri Chinmoy's students was waiting. Sri Chinmoy introduced the members of the choir, mentioning their various countries of origin, and the choir performed the song by Sri Chinmoy dedicated to President Mugabe, as well as several quotations by the President that Sri Chinmoy had set to music./

PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE: A HEART-ENLIGHTENMENT-HERO

President Robert Mugabe, President!

You were your Africa's streaming tears.
You are your Africa's blooming cheers.

/Sri Chinmoy introduced the presentation of the U Thant Peace Award with the following remarks:/

Dear and revered President Mugabe, it is a great honour for me and for the members of our Peace Meditation at the United Nations to present to you our U Thant Peace Award.

President Mugabe, for many years you and your freedom-longing colleagues struggled valiantly and suffered severely under unjust rule. Fearlessly you defended your "one man, one vote" principle, despite the retaliation which sent you to prison for a number of years. Although highly educated, you always valued the participation of your less-learned countrymen, and indeed, during your Presidency you have championed the cause of education for all your people. Trained and experienced as a teacher, dear President Mugabe, you have taught many subjects to your students, but to us, and to your country, you have provided the most significant, the most meaningful and the most powerful lesson: the lesson of unity.

Despite the years of strife which pitted white against black and black against black, when the sun of independence finally dawned and Zimbabwe proudly became Africa's fiftieth independent state, you boldly and convincingly proclaimed a government of national unity. Immediately, as Prime Minister, you included white minority representatives in your cabinet. Again, you welcomed your long-time African foe into your government, making him Vice President. Your words on this occasion could serve as a credo for all peace-builders. You said, dear President, "We do not want to leave behind a legacy of division. We want to lay the foundation of a Zimbabwe with one people, one nation. We can now move into the future hand in hand, knowing that we leave behind us a united country, instead of going to our graves separately, leaving behind us a divided country."

To us, dear President, your noble deeds teach the supreme necessity of discarding the darkness-bound past and moving confidently toward the sunlit future. We can clearly see that, with your wise all-inclusiveness, you have set a shining example for your people and given your beloved Zimbabwe a foundation of peace and stability during its crucial formative years. In so doing, you have also hastened the progress and fulfilment of your Zimbabwe's aspiring sister-nations on this great continent.

Dear President, we cannot omit your staunch advocacy of the rights of women, a cause which was championed by your beloved wife, Sally. Although she is now with God, we wish to offer both of you our prayerful thoughts, our soulful concern and our grateful appreciation, as we present to you our U Thant Peace Award.

/Sri Chinmoy then read the inscription on the Award./

The U Thant Peace Award is presented to His Excellency Comrade Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, for his:

- life-long commitment to the independence of his country and to its attainment of lasting justice and peace;
- extraordinary determination to forge a government of unity, with participation by all races and ethnic groups, making peace-building partners of former enemies;
- courageous conviction and stalwart integrity complemented by an enlightened wisdom that values the best of the old, the brightest of the new and their enduring oneness-strength-victory;
- illustrious leadership in the arena of blossoming African nation-states and eloquent spokesmanship for a progressive and dynamic comity of nations in tomorrows world.

Sri Chinmoy: The Peace Meditation \\
at the United Nations \\

1 January 1996

/President Mugabe:/ Our revered guest Sri Chinmoy and members of the Peace Meditation, the choir that has sung in praise of me and in praise of the people of Zimbabwe, may I, in response to this magnificent gesture from all of you, say how deeply touched I am by the generosity of the members of the Peace Meditation at the United Nations in not just visiting Zimbabwe, but visiting me in particular, and bestowing on me the honours that I have received this morning, the greatest of which is the U Thant Peace Award.

I want to say that I am very greatly touched by this spiritual, generous and extremely charitable act, which, as it goes deep into my heart, evokes thoughts of our world-the need this world feels particularly for the one fundamental virtue, that of peace and stability. This peace and stability can never occur unless there is an acceptance of man by man, of nation by nation, of all of us accepting one another as members of one family. And that peace derives from the heart, from the love that we show to one another in our own country. Whether we are Zimbabweans or South Africans, or we are Indians or Chinese or Americans or British or German or Swedish, the starting point is that we must love our neighbour, which is really the teaching in the Bible as well as in the Koran. It is the same teaching wherever you go, whether you are a Buddhist or a Hindu. We must love each other fundamentally. If that precept is accepted by us first within our home, then we will accept it within our nation. Then further, we will accept it as the bond between nations.

The United Nations would be meaningless unless it worked for that love. When it was first created in 1945, it was against a background of vicious quarrelling and vicious war where millions of people died, especially those of Jewish extraction; where bombs had been thrown on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, devastating the people of Japan and creating horror throughout the world. Those who threw those bombs threw them, in their own reckoning, as a means to achieve peace, but it was a devastating means to achieve peace. To this day we cannot forget the horror that those bombs created.

The United Nations was created against that background, essentially to achieve international peace and security. But that objective cannot be achieved in toto unless there is a basic acceptance of the ideal of oneness by individuals at all levels, especially the levels of the rulers, those in the hierarchy of authority, so they can then, through their example, influence everybody else down the line.

Here in Zimbabwe, we fought for peace, democratic rule and the right of people to choose their own governments. Having achieved that objective, we looked back and saw that thousands of people had died, many of them very young people. We saw the bombs killing little kids who were in the bush, little kids in refugee camps. It was a whole scene of horror throughout those 14 years of our struggle.

Once the British flag was lowered and the Zimbabwean flag went up, we said to ourselves: what will yield us greater benefits-to pursue a policy of vengeance against the wrong-doers of the past or to forgive them? That flag which has gone up, the Zimbabwean flag, binds all of us-former enemies and former allies-because whether yesterday we fought each other or we were friends, we cannot avoid each other anymore. We are together in one camp; our destiny is one. We must work now for that common destiny. That was our reckoning, and we said "no more vengeance." The correct policy should be that of national reconciliation. That is why we have even Jan Smith-with all that background of horror that he wreaked on our people-living here, still farming, still talking, still criticising us for lacking democracy, and still living like anybody else. Jokingly we say, "That head he owes to us;" he has a borrowed head, because we were entitled to take it, but we did not.

That is our situation now. We still have the problems that confront all developing countries. We share them with everybody else: underdevelopment; occasionally when we get drought, there is hunger; we have disease, the AIDS epidemic. But our people have a strong will, determination, that sense of industry, to work with government, to work for themselves and for the nation, uplifting themselves and together, as they do that, the whole of our nation.

We still are very far from achieving the goal of industrialisation, and with it also the upliftment of the standards of living of our people. Over the last 15 years we have tried our best. Yes, our people will need more education, and we have a policy of education for all. Regarding health, we have a policy of health for all. We have a policy also of leveling up the imbalances that were created by colonialism. The segregation that existed in the past has now gone, but the standards of living of the people are not leveled yet.

We know that one day we shall achieve those goals. However, we cannot achieve them, can never, ever achieve them, unless the people are united. This unity must not be artificial, it must not come from the top, descending down to the people. The top must give direction, but unity must come from the people themselves, from their own hearts, accepting one another as brothers and sisters of one family.

That is what drove us in the 1980s to create a government of national unity. In December 1987, after the troubles that we had between the two major parties in the western part of the country, Dr. Joshua Nkomo and I, as Prime Minister, signed an accord of unity before President Banana that never again shall we subject our people to the kind of suffering that they had over the previous four or five years when there was so much fighting because of dissident activities. We agreed to unite our party and said to ourselves that unity, that accord, must last. But it cannot last until we accept it from the bottom of our hearts.

The mind can plan; it plans lots of things. It can plan development; it can plan wars-the mind runs mad sometimes. But the controlling mechanism to it remains the one fundamental emotion of love. If there is love, then the mind will be directed, and that will moderate it. This is your teaching. It is the spiritual virtue that members of the Peace Meditation at the United Nations are trying to impart. The excellent work Sri Chinmoy has been doing, the meditations at the United Nations, are his own contribution, which has been accepted by personalities of high standing like the Pope, Mother Teresa, the Secretaries-General of the United Nations and others-and which will certainly be accepted by the leaders of our region.

That role we praise, and we say "God bless you." May this New Year, 1996, see your efforts flourishing, and greater peace coming to our nations and to the international community. I want to thank you immensely for recognising the small efforts that we have made towards creating peace in Zimbabwe. I thank you.

/Sri Chinmoy:/ Most beloved President, we shall cherish your most enlightening message on New Year's Day in the inmost recesses of our heart. Today the new year begins, and you have blessed us with your most illumining message-the message of hope, the message of peace, the message of promise. For that we are offering you our hearts' deepest gratitude, deepest appreciation and deepest admiration.

With your kind permission I would like my students to sing a song congratulating you for what you have done for your beloved country. This morning's newspaper has said you take pride in the unity, higher education and good health of your country. Here you have achieved so much, and again you are promising to the world that you will do infinitely more.

We most fervently pray to the Almighty God to bless you with every opportunity to pilot your countrymen to a higher destination. I am asking my students to congratulate you in our most humble, prayerful way for the momentous message that you have blessingfully offered to us.

/The choir performed the song "Congratulation."/

/Sri Chinmoy:/ Now we wish to offer you our "thanks" with a prayerful song.

/The choir performed the song "Thank You."/



* Meeting With King Goodwill Zwelithini

  :CITE-KEY: SCFA:3
  :END:


/On 23 January 1996, King Goodwill Kabhekuzulu Zwelithini attended Sri Chinmoy's Peace Concert in City Hall, Durban, South Africa. He gave the following welcome address./

/King Zwelithini:/ When the world turns against itself, as it does, human life becomes trivial and cheap. The death statistics of the USSR, Burundi, Algeria, Israel and Palestine, India, Sri Lanka and KwaZulu/Natal back home, highlight the lack of peace and unity within the human population. There is hardly a single day that passes without TV and press media showing human destruction by humans. Here in South Africa, KwaZulu/Natal is a classic example of anarchy, disunity, lack of understanding, lack of political tolerance, faction fighting, rampant violence and political killings.

In other words, the world should unite in pursuit of peace. I take relief from the fact that there are men and women like Sri Chinmoy and his peace group who have dedicated their lives to promoting peace. I have carefully studied the qualifications of this man, who is an international peace philosopher, an author, a poet, an artist, an athlete, a spiritual leader, because it is rare to find a man of this age who is a combination of all these noble qualities. His life supports the observation that a man who is at peace with himself can effectively promote peace amongst other people.

He is propelled by the spiritual desire to see peace reigning among people. He is also an inspiration to us here in KwaZulu/Natal and South Africa in general. We have to shed hatred, we have to shed destructive competition, we have to shed jealousy, we have to shed ethnic and racial biases, we have to shed feelings of self-centredness, we have to replace narrow self-interest with broad, common interest.

The visit of Sri Chinmoy and his peace group is a fountain of inspiration to us. We hope the message will get across that human life is more important than political power. We hope to internalise the message that we ultimately return to our Source, God. We have to revive our noble Ubuntu practices.

With these few words I want to welcome Sri Chinmoy and his peace group in KwaZulu/Natal. Your visit and this Peace Concert are a blessing to me and my people. Incidentally, I am also a lover of peace. I will gladly sacrifice my sleep if and when there is an opportunity to meet for the promotion of peace. May your visit and Peace Concert spread a new wave of love, peace and unity in this troubled province of ours. Thank you.

/Sri Chinmoy:/ Your Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini, I wish to offer you gratitude from the inmost recesses of my heart for the signal and momentous blessings that you have bestowed upon my heart of aspiration and my life of dedication. This morning I was inspired from deep within to compose a song about you, your Majesty. This prayerful song I now wish my students to sing for you. Most humbly I am offering this song to your Majesty.

/Sri Chinmoy read out the words to the song:/

#+BEGIN_VERSE

O King Goodwill, O King Goodwill, Goodwill!
You are your heart's world-oneness-peace-dream-thrill.
You tell the world: "No stark ignorance-fight.
Dive deep within to swim in the sea of Light."
O Pilot-Zenith of your fond Zulu tribe,
In your heart's rainbow-sky, peace-promise shall thrive.

#+END_VERSE

/The choir performed the song before the entire Peace Concert audience of about one thousand people. The King and Queen thanked the singers graciously, shaking hands with each one individually./

/Remarks were then offered by the Acting Mayor, Councillor Panday, and the Chairperson of the Metropolitan Executive Council, Mr. Obed Mlaba./

/Mr. Obed Mlaba, Chairperson of the Executive Council, Durban Metropolitan Area:/ Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome again, to all of you. On behalf of the Executive Council of the Durban Metropolitan Area, I am extremely honoured to welcome Sri Chinmoy here tonight. For all of us in Durban, nothing is more important than to establish a lasting and true peace. So it is extremely significant and important to us that you, Sri Chinmoy, have chosen to come to our land at this turning point in our lives, in Durban and KwaZulu/Natal and in our country. For us, you represent the power of the heart and of the spirit of God within each human being as we strive to bring goodness and peace into our lives.

I am extremely pleased and happy to announce that our Executive Council has today voted to become part of the Sri Chinmoy Peace-Blossoms programme which links together nearly 1000 natural wonders and important locations worldwide for the cause of peace. On behalf of all Durbanites, may I say that we feel truly honoured to be a part of this global initiative to foster peace. We need your innovative and heart to heart, person to person peace programmes very badly, and we assure you that we shall work closely with your organisation to play our role in our common quest for a world of peace.

I would now like to read the text of the plaque which is here on stage, and to present you, Sri Chinmoy, with this signed declaration. The plaque will be installed soon at a very prominent place here in City Hall so that all of our citizens may receive the inspiration to lead more peaceful and fulfilling lives.

/King Zwelithini then unveiled the plaque declaring Durban a "Sri Chinmoy Peace Metropolitan Area"./

/Later, at a reception held in the City Hall, the King remarked to Sri Chinmoy/ "Brother, brother, you cannot imagine what you have done for me and for our country! We need only a few-not many-men of peace like you to bring peace to our country."

/On 29 January 1996, President Nelson Mandela received Sri Chinmoy in Johannesburg at the headquarters of the African National Congress./

/The two had met previously, on 22 June 1990, immediately prior to Mr. Mandela's address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York./

/This time, the President came to join Sri Chinmoy and sixteen of his students in the Conference Room at ANC Headquarters./

/President Mandela (greeting Sri Chinmoy):/ My dear friend, how are you?

/Sri Chinmoy:/ Beloved President, I am so grateful to you for so kindly allowing me to be in your blessingful presence.

/President Mandela entered the conference room, where he was greeted by applause and shook each person's hand with great kindness. President Mandela (greeting the singers):/ It is a real pleasure to see all of you. You all look very impressive. I am so happy to see you.

/Sri Chinmoy (asking the President to sit down):/ As your time is very limited, we would like to sing some songs which I have composed in your honour, and then I would like to offer you our U Thant Peace Award.

/President Mandela:/ It is so difficult to sit down when you are all standing!

/Sri Chinmoy (showing the President the sheets of music):/ These are the two songs that they are going to sing right now. (The choir performed "A Perfect Justice-Voice" and "Long Walk to Freedom.")

/Sri Chinmoy:/ Now the singers will sing four of your momentous utterances that I have set to music. /(Showing the President the words and music of the four songs)/ They will be singing these, and then we shall offer you our U Thant Peace Award.

/President Mandela:/ This is absolutely wonderful!

/The choir performed the four songs./

/Sri Chinmoy introduced the/ U Thant Peace Award /presentation with the following words:/

Highly esteemed and beloved President Mandela, it is the greatest honour for me and my students to offer you our most profound and soulful appreciation in the form of our U Thant Peace Award.

Dear President, yours is the life of a supremely chosen instrument, embodying both the excruciating bondage-pangs and the soaring freedom-dreams of your nation. The sweet hopes of your innocent childhood you unhesitatingly surrendered to Destiny's challenging call. The loftiest goal of universal liberation you wholeheartedly embraced. Impossibility, defeat and bitterness are words never to be found in your oneness-heart-dictionary; unfathomable courage, unparalleled determination and indomitable strength radiate on every page.

Dear President Mandela, your life of unconditional sacrifice and your beloved country's miracle-transformation are inseparable. Sleeplessly your lifeboat is plying between Africa's bleeding heart-shore and Africa's smiling soul-shore. Your triumphant peace-loving and oneness-building spirit the entire aspiring world shall forever love, cherish and adore.

/President Mandela:/ This is a wonderful honour. I do not have the words to express it. It is such a pity that I am seeing you at the last moment because I must proceed to Pretoria and fly to Cape Town today. But when my Comrade Zuma phoned me and told me about you, I said I would be honoured to meet you, and I hope you will not mind the fact that I can only spare just a few minutes because of the tight programme which I have.

This gift, this award from you is one that I am going to respect a great deal, and which encourages me in the difficult work that we are doing. It is not easy to preach the message of peace and reconciliation in a country which for more than three centuries has been divided by racial conflict and tensions, and where many people have lost their lives because of torture and persecution. It is not very easy, but we are trying.

This gesture makes it possible for us to be able to do this work. To be appreciated by an organisation like yours is a real shot in the arm, and I am very grateful to you.

/Sri Chinmoy: Thank you. (Showing a newspaper article about his visit to the President's cell on Robben Island)/ This is about my prayerful visit to Robben Island. In the cell I was praying, and this is the message that I offered there: "There was a time when this cave-room played the role of punishment. Now this room plays the role of humanity's sacred, illumining and fulfilling shrine."

/President Mandela (reading the message):/ That is very good! I am really honoured.

/Sri Chinmoy (presenting his book "The Garland of Nation-Souls"):/ These are the talks that I have given at the United Nations over the years.

/Sri Chinmoy points to the caption under the picture of his meeting with the President at the United Nations in 1990:/ This is the message I gave you at that time: "South Africa sleeplessly needs the fragrance of your heart for its liberation and peace, and the whole world soulfully needs the garden of your life for its inspiration and bliss."

/President Mandela:/ I will read this with great interest.

Sri Chinmoy: Now we will end with a short song I have composed in honour of Africa.

/The choir performed "Africa."/

/President Mandela:/ Thank you very much. Thank you. I cannot express in words my joy, but I wish you good luck and success in what you are doing. It is in the interest of the entire humanity and the world. I am really honoured. Thank you.

/Sri Chinmoy:/ We are so grateful to you.

/The President again shook hands with everyone present, thanking them as he left./
