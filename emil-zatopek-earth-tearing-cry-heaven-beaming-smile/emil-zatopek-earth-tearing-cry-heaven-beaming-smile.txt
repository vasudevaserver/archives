Confidence is good. Self-confidence is better. Confidence in God is by far the best. Again, the human instrument must have faith both in his sincere efforts and in the Grace from above. In the case of Zatopek, higher reality and higher divinity descended on him precisely because he had confidence in his own capacities and also an implicit faith in the vision and satisfaction of the higher worlds. On the strength of his unparalleled confidence in himself and confidence in God, he not only conquered the runners' world but also illumined the consciousness of the runners' world.

Life and sports cannot be separated; they are one. As a matter of fact, life itself is a game. This game can be played extremely well, provided the player develops consciously or unconsciously the capacity to invoke the transcendental energy which is always manifested in action. The present-day sportsmen, according to Zatopek, are neither aware of this nor doing the right thing. He says, "Sportsmen are like children; they don't know anything about life. They only know to train and compete. They meet only other athletes."

Zatopek's dedication and will power are Himalayan. Day in and day out, year after year during his training regimen, the courageous champion remained faithful and dedicated to the course he had set for himself. He clearly describes his training philosophy: "If one can stick to the training throughout the many long years, then will power is no longer a problem. It's raining? That doesn't matter. I am tired? That's beside the point. It's simply that I just have to."

A particular message of Emil Zatopek should be imprinted on the tablet of every runner's heart: "You must be fast enough. You must have endurance. So you run fast for speed, and repeat it many times for endurance."

Another significant message he has offered to us: "There's a great advantage in training under unfavourable conditions." For when victory dawns, everything becomes sweet, illumining and fulfilling. At that time, unfavourable conditions are no longer seen as unfavourable but as necessary steps to bring to the fore the runner's ultimate capacity.

Zatopek is sincerity incarnate. He has always given the topmost priority to truth in every aspect of his life. At times, his sincerity has been so soulfully moving. On the eve of the 1948 Olympics, his sincerity reached the highest height. "It was my first competition in Olympic Games and I was surprised to come to Olympic stadium and to read most important things about the Games: 'Not to win but to take part'. What -- not to win? Ah, but I wish to win! "

Zatopek was a perfect stranger to deception. He was honesty incarnate. But his style of running, which was alarmingly peculiar and awkward, to say the least, fooled runners and spectators alike. One European coach observed: "He runs like a man who has just been stabbed in the heart. "

A life without humour is undoubtedly a life of slow but certain failure. Humour is the spice of life. Humour shakes off tension-fever, unnerves frustration-night and brings to the fore spontaneously encouraging reality and fulfilling beauty. A Chinese restaurant once inspired Zatopek, and his inspiration he offered to us in a strikingly amusing way: "There are three things worth living for: American luxury, Japanese women and Chinese food."

A sense of humour ought to be cultivated by everybody every day, for a sense of humour is nothing short of a wisdom-tree. This wisdom-tree serves us, feeds us, illumines us and protects us. Zatopek's sense of humour was unique. In response to criticism of his running style, he once declared, "I shall learn to have a better style once they start judging races according to their beauty. So long as it's a question of speed, then my attention will be directed to seeing how fast I can cover the ground." Not self-denial, but self-defense, he felt, is of paramount importance.

It is not true that human life is nothing but a series of misfortunes, a chain of bondage and a night of destruction. Sometimes happiness-flood does inundate certain human beings. Such an experience lasts for the entire span of an individual's life and offers continuously a new significance to the pilgrims who have come to enjoy the earthly pilgrimage. Here Zatopek comments on the day in the Helsinki Olympics when he had won his third gold medal -- for the marathon -- and his wife, Dana, had taken a gold medal with a new Olympic record in the women's javelin: "It was a wonderful day. It was 24 July 1952. I remember it always. Indeed, it was all happiness for us."

The immortal runner was also a linguist. He was at home in German, French, English and Czechoslovakian. He felt that if he could speak to others in their own native tongues, then they would get more joy and enthusiasm. In the dressing room, Emil Zatopek would greet his opponents warmly. "Comment ca va? . . . Wie geht's? . .. How goes it?" Others sometimes did not greet him because of fear or nervousness. They did not want to lose their power of concentration. Zatopek was also nervous to some extent, but he had strength in his inner life, so he felt even if he had lost the race he would not feel miserable. He worked hard; that was his satisfaction. He had confidence in his ability; that was his satisfaction.

After all those dark days of the war, the bombing, the killing, the starvation, the revival of the Olympics was as if the sun had come out. I went into the Olympic Village in 1948 and suddenly there were no more frontiers, no more barriers. Just the people meeting together. It was wonderfully warm. Men and women who had lost five years of life were back again."

Instead of being consumed with pride, he was a radiant example of spontaneous concern and affection. On the eve of his last Olympic competition in 1956, Zatopek came to Calcutta with his wife Dana to run in a five-kilometre race. He was then 35 years old. The Indian champion, Gulzara Singh, lost to the Czechoslovakian badly. And what was his reaction? Singh touched Zatopek's shoes and sprinkled dust from the Czechoslovakian's feet onto his head. Perhaps only an Indian could offer such adoration to a fellow runner. The immortal Zatopek, a five-medal Olympian, also did something to capture the very breath of the Indian runner. He made him a present of his running shoes.

The seeker-runner in Zatopek is aware of the supreme truth that admiration and adoration are not a sign of inferiority but two divine qualities which eventually bring tremendous satisfaction to all walks of life.

Through the expansion of his heart, Zatopek always wanted to give and get joy. There is a most significant incident involving Ron Clarke. Ron Clarke was such a great runner. He set so many world records, but never got any gold medals. Zatopek's sympathetic heart felt the sadness of Clarke's heart. So in secret he gave Ron Clarke one of his gold medals, putting it in the younger runner's suitcase while he was visiting him. When Clarke got home and opened his suitcase, to his wide surprise he found Zatopek's gold medal.

Each doctor has an opinion of his own, but a patient can have faith only in one doctor. Otherwise, the patient will dig his own grave. Again, each individual has his own appetite and a special liking for particular foods. But if we pay all attention to food, then we shall get unfortunately unhealthy and frustrating experiences. Zatopek illumines us: "At one time I was so confused by various doctors' good advice that I almost died of hunger and thirst. If you come to think of it, you never see deer, dogs and rabbits worrying about their menus and yet they run much faster than humans."

A man of principle he was. Nothing could swerve him from his inner duty. Humiliation untold he was ready to tolerate. Whenever his inner moral fibre was severely tested, he always came out easily triumphant, as was the case with his Olympic ordeals.

When the Russians invaded Czechoslovakia, Zatopek was a supporter of Alexander Dubcek. His loyalty to Dubcek was incredible. After the invasion, the Russians expelled him from the Czech army, in which he had held the rank of colonel.

From being a colonel, he had to take the job of a garbage collector in Prague. He suffered the excruciating pangs of humiliation, but cheerfully he went through it. Because he was a man of such principle, his friends and admirers became closer to him. Some kind-hearted men even helped him in his new job. He did a few more menial jobs, but indomitable was his spirit. Cheerful was his life. He braved the storms of life smilingly and thus triumphed in the battlefield of real life.
