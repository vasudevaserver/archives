And your mother, Goddess,
Need you here on earth
And nowhere else."

THE DAY I WANTED TO SAIL

The day I wanted to sail
With doubt,
Our boat did not start.

The day I wanted to sail
With fear,
Our boat sank when the journey
Was three minutes old.

The day I wanted to sail
With love,
God immediately jumped into our boat
And on we sailed.
Both love and I just
Slept, sang and danced in the boat.
But God did something more:
He led us all the way
With His Nectar-light.
