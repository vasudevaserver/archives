You taught your countrymen how to wake up from a long-cherished slumber. You taught them how to open their eyes and look within, look around and look above. Some of your countrymen were extremely grateful to your unimaginably good heart, while others were displeased with you for putting an end to their cherished ignorance-sleep. Still others foolishly wanted to run faster than the fastest immediately.

Gorbachev, the awakener, lovingly and compassionately said to them: "Comrades, we are by no means ready to run the fastest. We have just awakened. We can and we must first walk slowly and steadily, without fear, without doubt, without suspicion and without self-abnegation." Alas, the coach who was teaching them how to play life's vastness-oneness-reality-game became a victim of ruthless attacks.

SRI CHINMOY'S DEDICATION OF HIS

JAPAN PEACE CONCERT

TO PRESIDENT GORBACHEV

10 March 1992

Nippon Budokan, Tokyo, Japan

Today's Peace Concert I am most lovingly and most gratefully dedicating to President Gorbachev, whose Perestroika-Vision-Light ended the Cold War and sowed peace-seeds inside the heart-garden of the world-home for the transformation of the human mind and the perfection of human life.

About a year ago-to be precise, 10 months and 23 days ago-President Gorbachev came to visit Japan, Beauty's Land and Duty's Hand. At a dinner in the Emperor's Palace his oneness-heart voiced forth, "Our countries and peoples are neighbours. Our ties are many centuries old. There are many historical documents testifying to the mutual attraction between the Russians and the Japanese."At the same dinner, the unparalleled peace-lover in him also proclaimed, "Allow me also to express the wish that the presciently chosen name of the era of Your Majesty's rule, 'Heisei,' which means "achievement of universal peace," may also come true in relations between the Soviet Union and Japan."

May the morning light of Japan and the serving heart of President Gorbachev together grow and glow to accelerate the perfection-promise of humanity.

/The Japan Peace Concert was attended by over 12,000 people./

We wish you, dear friends, tremendous success in all your activities and initiatives which are aimed at the welfare of the people of Poland and the socialist renewal of your homeland."

5 January 1992

Happy Birthday! most esteemed Sister Raisa Maximowna Gorbachev.

On this most auspicious occasion, I am praying to the Absolute Lord Supreme to grant you His choicest Blessings, Love, Joy and Satisfaction.

You are the only real Queen of the immortal Soviet Union that proudly embodies our Beloved President Gorbachev's unparalleled Hope and Promise. You are the only woman down the sweep of centuries to help her husband with the loftiest inspiration and the strongest encouragement to transform his dream-sky into his reality-sun.

To the extreme joy of the aspiring humanity, our President chose the 25th of December, (the day the Saviour Christ blessed the earth), to render his vision-flooded, historical resignation.

Our President is not dethroned. No, never! On the contrary, he is unquestionably and permanently enthroned inside the gratitude-heart-garden of the freedom-searching and peace-loving humanity.

O First Lady of the Soviet Union, I have read your book /I Hope/. Your book at once houses and reveals the Illumination of your radiant mind, the Aspiration of your blossomed heart and the Dedication of your self-giving life in a unique way. May we request you most fervently to enrich the Gorbachev-thirsty and Gorbachev-hungry world with many more successors of your /I Hope/.

Sri Chinmoy

P.S. My very best greetings of the New Year to the President and all members of your family.

O Queen of the Soviet Union,

My most esteemed sister Raisa Maximowna,

It was most kind of you to autograph for me your immortal book /I Hope/ with your deep and compassionate affection. I shall treasure it inside the very depth of my gratitude-heart. My German student Petra Menge was so fortunate to have met with you and to have been able to offer you a rose, which I wanted her to give you from me. Like me, everybody must treasure your invaluable book.

I was extremely happy to meet with your dearest daughter, Irina, in New York last month. While I was talking to her, I was so clearly feeling and seeing her parents' infinite wisdom, light, compassion and sacrifice.

You are a supreme authority on art. In May there will be an art exhibit in New York of my paintings which will last for about a month. I am going to dedicate this exhibit to you. I shall be so deeply honoured and grateful if you could come and bless the exhibit just for fleeting five minutes. It will mean so much to me and to my students from all over the world.

I am praying to my Lord Supreme most fervently for your good health and for an extra supply of dynamic energy for you.

With my heart's warmest compliments and gratitude,

Sri Chinmoy
