The West gets satisfaction
From large-scale things.

Tinier than the tiniest
And capture the Infinite Supreme
Inside finite man-made forms.
Therein lies Japan's
Message of perfection.

Japan has touched her goal.

At any time of day or night.

Carefully, devotedly, soulfully
And sleeplessly.

Your dauntless instrument.

Many have come
Into the Supreme's Golden Boat;
Many have left.
Many have appeared
And many have disappeared.
Many are outwardly following the spiritual life,
But inwardly they are elsewhere,
Millions of miles away.
Again, some seekers are inwardly with God,
But outwardly they want to lead another life -
A life of lethargy, indulgence, disobedience,
Unconscious if not conscious self-deception,
Plus self-mockery.

The unfaithful seekers.

I am waiting for them.
Again, it is You who have told me
That there shall come a time
When You will ask me to put an end
To my watching and waiting games.
Then You will give me a new game to play:
The game of justice-light.
