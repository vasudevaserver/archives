Is unclear.

For it does not allow me
To go forward
To see the beauty of truth
And the light of joy.

God has a very special Concern
For the newly-arrived souls.
He does not want them to mix freely
With the old souls,
Who have surrendered to
ignorance-night.
He wants these newly-arrived souls
To fight right from the beginning
Against ignorance-night
And establish His supreme Victory
Here on earth.
