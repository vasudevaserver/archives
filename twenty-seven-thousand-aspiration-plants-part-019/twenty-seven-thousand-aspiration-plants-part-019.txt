To bring his inner existence
To the fore.
He is indeed a chosen seeker,
For there are many, many on earth
Who simply will not be able
To do what he has so easily
And so spontaneously done.

You do have
To run the fastest
And reach the Destination of Newness.
Now you need
The power of meditation
To enter into the Goal of Fulness.

Do we see that there is something
Called sacrifice.
On the divine level
There is no such thing
As sacrifice.
It is all oneness --
Oneness-perfection
And oneness-satisfaction.

Even a great champion,
If he is not spiritual,
May greatly suffer
From a baseless future-fear.

Tomorrow I may not be able
To perform as well as today.
The day after tomorrow
Somebody will surpass me
And take away my glory."

From the human life
We are trying to reach
The divine life.
So let us at least give up
Our animal qualities.
Let our hearts be sympathetic
To our fellow travellers.
Let us allow God to fulfil
At least one Dream of His
In and through us.

My mind will tell me
Only what others have taught it:
"A flower is beautiful."
But my heart feels and sees everything
As a new experience.
It may even discover tremendous power
Inside a tiny flower.
Then how can we say
That the heart is mistaken
When it tells us,
"A flower is powerful."
