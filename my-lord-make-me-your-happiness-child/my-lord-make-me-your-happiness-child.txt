#+BEGIN_VERSE

My sweet Lord,
I wish to make
A most sincere confession.
I have heard the words
Eternity and Immortality
Countless times.
To my extreme sorrow,
I do not know
What they precisely mean.
"My child,
Eternity is
My Heart's universal Hope.
Immortality is
My Eye's transcendental Promise."

#+BEGIN_VERSE

My dear Lord,
We are Your children.
How is it
That You have not made us
As happy as You are?
"My child,
Your way of happiness
And My Way of happiness
Are two totally different things."
My dear Lord,
When I say happiness,
What I mean is
My supremacy-declaration.
"My child,
When I say happiness,
What I mean is
My Oneness-Satisfaction.
"You cannot and do not claim Me
As your own, very own.
Therefore you are unhappy.
But I can and do claim you
As My own, very own.
Therefore I am happy."

#+BEGIN_VERSE

My Lord Supreme,
Every day my life-boat
Plies between
Your two Compassion-Shores:
Time and speed.
I pray to You to grant me
The lightning-speed
While I am plying my boat
To the speed-destination.
And while I am plying my boat
To the time-destination,
Do bless me with
Eternity's patience.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

My Beloved Supreme,
Out of 100,
What do You give me
When I give You
My mind's love, my heart's devotion
And my life's surrender?
"My child, I give you 9 1/4
When you give Me your mind's love.
"I give you 79 1/2
When you give Me your heart's devotion.
"I give you 99 3/4
When you give Me your life's surrender."
My Beloved Supreme,
When can You give me
100 out of 100?
"My child,
Not until you are empty
Of your curiosity-stupidity."

#+BEGIN_VERSE

My dear Lord,
I am a staunch Catholic.
Therefore, am I wrong if I say
That I alone am entitled to Heaven?
"My child,
I am afraid if I tell you
That you alone
Are entitled to Heaven,
Then your Protestant cousins
Will sue Me."
My dear Lord,
Then who is entitled to Heaven?
"My child,
The human losing whose heart-cry
Can fly up to Heaven,
And whose soul-smile
Can fly down to earth."

My Supreme Lord,

To Heaven?

No.

In your heart-devotion,
Then definitely yes."

My Beloved Supreme,
Is there any right time for me
To do the right thing?

Not tomorrow,
Not even today!

To do the right thing
Is now,
At this very moment,
Plus
Here and nowhere else."

#+BEGIN_VERSE

My Lord Supreme,
Are You displeased with me
Because I have not
Cheerfully surrendered myself
To Your Will?
"My child,
I am not displeased with you,
But the real reality in you
Is your soul.
"Each day when it sees
That you are not making
Your cheerful surrender
To My Omniscience,
Omnipresence
And Omnipotence,
Your soul carries unnecessarily
An elephant-weight,
A volcano-frustration
And a tornado-destruction.
"My child,
Each second
Either you surrender to My Will
Or I surrender to your stupidity.
"I can go on surrendering to you,
But if you do not surrender
To My Infinity's Compassion-Heart,
Then each day
Is a failure-cry of your soul,
And I shed endless tears
With your poor soul."

#+BEGIN_VERSE

My Lord Supreme,
Why are You so unkind to me?
You have given me no capacity.
Whereas,
You have given my soul the capacity,
Out of Your infinite Bounty,
To be in a self-absorbing trance,
To enjoy Your Immortality's
Infinite Compassion.
"My child,
In comparison to your soul,
You are too young.
When you become as mature
As your soul,
I shall give you
The same kind of capacity
To do My Work on earth."

My dear Lord,
I have forgotten.
Do tell me
If You have given me
Anything to bring down
From Heaven to earth.
"My child,
I gave you My Vision-Eye
To bring down
From Heaven to earth."
My dear Lord,
What will You be giving me
To carry from earth to Heaven?
"My child,
I shall give you
My Manifestation-Feet
To carry from earth to Heaven."

Please tell me
The name of the step.

Your life's union-surrender-step."

In Your absolutely new
And unprecedented creation.

My Lord Supreme,
What is the difference
Between faith and love?

Between faith and love.

Are two complementary souls.
"Faith is the heart of love
And love is the breath of faith."

I want only to be
A speck of humility-dust
To remind me
Of my sleepless service-life.
