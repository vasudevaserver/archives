I can never become as short or as thin as Barada is, so how can you expect me to run as fast as she does? I can't go back to her height and I can't go back to her weight, so she has to accept my surrender in the running-world.

At four o'clock in the morning I wanted to run for three miles, but the course I picked took fifty-two minutes. Then in the afternoon I asked Peter to take me along the same course. He measured it and found it was five miles and twelve hundred metres-practically six miles. How did I go so far? It is difficult to judge the distance if you don't know the route and you have to go just by time.

In the car I was wearing a running suit, a thick sweater and then a rubber suit on top of that. I even had on my hat and gloves. Peter turned on the heat as high as possible, and after checking the course, we continued driving in the car. All this to lose weight in Peter's "sauna"! After twenty minutes it was too much. We opened up the window. We droveanother two miles and then I walked for two miles.

In today's three-mile race in Flushing Meadow Park I saw Snigdha after one hundred metres. I couldn't believe it, but she was falling behind me. For eight hundred metres she ran with me and then she finally went ahead.

After the first four hundred metres I was still with the boys. What was I doing there? Mukunda and others were behind me. My time for the first mile was 6:39. Had it been only a one-mile race, for the last three hundred metres I could have gone faster, and my time for the mile would have been better.

Nirjhari caught me when I started walking. She passed me and left a large gap between us. I said, "Go ahead, go ahead!" Then Subala passed me, then Linda. Nayana passed me after a mile and a half. I said, "Go!"

In the five-mile race today I couldn't imagine what happened to Adrian from Australia. He started walking after one mile. Then after running for 150 metres, again he started walking. As I was watching him, I said to myself, "He has got my job." He is such an excellent runner, but he was walking after only one mile.

In the five-mile race I was very bad. I was telling Gangadhar to defeat Snigdha, his wife's best friend. But Gangadhar just raised his arms and surrendered. Of course, it was the human in me that told him to defeat her; the divine in me always wants whoever deserves it to win.

Gangadhar is a man. What was he doing behind Snigdha? When I encouraged him, the distance between him and Snigdha became even wider. The moment I told him to defeat her, Snigdha started going faster.

Later I saw Snighdha in her car quite happy and cheerful. I thought that definitely she had defeated Gangadhar. Then I found out that he had defeated her by one second.

Today when I went out on a short run, for at least two hundred metres I was following Prabhir. Then, after that I didn't see him at all. What happened to him I don't know. I was waiting for the light to change and I was looking forward. When I started running again, I didn't see Prabhir. At one point I turned around, but I saw only Dorothee from the Zurich Centre, who came out of the blue. Prabhir always reminds me of John Landy, the world champion runner.

* Exhaustion

  :END:


As you know, I am a wonderful runner. I can inspire my children to run, but when it is a matter of me personally, from the beginning to the end running is sheer torture. I run. Why? The secret reason is so that I will not get fat and compete with Indian swamis in fatness. But the main reason is to inspire my disciples to run, so that they can become fit instruments of the Supreme.

This morning I got inspiration to run at six o'clock. Usually I go running much earlier, but today I went late. I ran one, two, three, four, five and then six miles, until I reached Dan's Supreme Supermarket. This is my usual turnaround point on that course. Then I became tired and started running and walking. Three hundred metres I would run and then fifty metres I would walk. In that way I covered another three miles. Finally, I was totally exhausted. Totally is not an exaggeration; it is an understatement. I was seeing everything as white or black or brown. My eyes were not functioning at all!

I stood and rested for a while and then I started walking. While I was walking I saw a very old, crippled lady using a cane. I said, "O God, You are still kind to me. At least I don't belong to her group."

I was dying of thirst; I was so dehydrated! But I didn't have a cent with me. What could I do?

Now, begging is not in my line. God gave me stupid pride, which I still have. Three times I was about to beg individuals for a dime to make a phone call. But when I went near them, I said, "What will happen if they don't give me the dime?" That was my stupidity. I passed two gas stations and each time I was about to ask for water or for a dime, but again I was afraid of what would happen. At one point I saw a young boy. It seemed to me that he had money. I was about to tell him that if he gave me a dime, in fifteen minutes I would give him a ten dollar bill. Again I said, "What will happen if he does not give me the money?"

I was struggling and struggling. Perhaps I have never been so exhausted. I felt as if I had run fifty miles, which I have never done. Still I went on. At one place there was a sign that said "College Point." I stood there for five minutes and then I started walking. I had covered over two hundred metres when all of a sudden I saw a car stop near me. A gentleman came out of the car and asked me the way to College Point. As you know, I am not very good at giving directions. Most sympathetically I told him that I didn't know. Then I came back to my senses and realised that I had just seen the sign and had even been standing there. But by that time the car had passed by. That kind of tiredness I had!

When I was only six hundred metres away from my house, I was so exhausted that I said, "Let me wait here for ten minutes. Let me take rest for ten minutes." then I finally walked home.

So running can make people very tired if they are useless runners like me. It is always advisable to carry some change or a dollar with you. For me it is always advisable to take someone with me when I run-preferably someone with a car, not a runner. Yesterday I took Peter with me. But when you take someone with you, at that time you are not exhausted. Yesterday I ran seven miles. I was showing off, running quite fast. When you take someone along with you, at that time you do not need help. And then when you don't take someone, at that time all the world's help you need.

During our marathon in New Jersey I ran thirteen miles. For the first seven miles I ran at an 8:10 pace. X was running just a little ahead of me. She wasn't looking over her shoulder, but each time I came near her, all of a sudden her speed would increase. Whenever I came only four or five metres behind her, she would hear my footsteps and go faster. But she never looked behind her.

I tell my disciples to surrender, but I myself don't know how to surrender, especially to my girl runner-disciples. Each time I am determined to defeat them badly.

During my thirteen-mile run today, only once did I walk a few metres while drinking water. Otherwise, the rest of the way I ran.

The first two years I ran in the New York City Marathon, I had cramps in spite of my practising. This year, I have not been able to practise. How will I be able to run the marathon?

When you run long distance, as opposed to short distance, you sometimes feel that you won't be able to complete the race. You are afraid that you will get cramps and won't be able to finish the distance.

At five o'clock this morning when I went out to run, inwardly I blessed X's soul because today is his birthday. Then, a little after six-thirty, I went out to run again and this time I saw X in the physical. He was near Y's house. I was running down the 150th Street hill when I saw him press his wristwatch and start running with long strides. I thought that I would turn around and meet him. But then I said to myself, "I will never be able to catch him."

As in the outer running I struggle and struggle and struggle in order to survive-while winning the race is far, far beyond my imagination-even so, most of my disciples struggle and struggle and struggle in the inner running. Unfortunately, the goal is still a far, far cry for them.

But who knows, in the near or distant future I may make satisfactory progress in my outer running, although I just completed half a century. Similarly, my disciples can and will make satisfactory progress in their inner running.

This is my fervent hope, and I do hope that my Beloved Supreme, out of His infinite Bounty, will fulfil my soulful and prayerful wish.

The day before yesterday was a wonderful day. Around six o'clock in the morning I was running in front of my house, doing my speed work-fifty metres slow and fifty metres fast. Then I saw the fat lady who is very fond of me, with her two dogs. Two or three years ago she had a fight with another lady while walking her dog, and I took the fat lady's side. So she always shows me her gratitude.

After each hundred metres, I was taking rest for a few seconds. At one particular moment I took rest and walked. The white dog was following me-not chasing me-and barking.

The lady said to me, "So you see, you see!"

I said, "Good morning, good morning!"

The lady said, "Like your other followers, my dog also is following you. He will be a very good follower."

So I thanked her.

I wanted to do ten, but I did only one.

At another point Ilona and I were running near each other. Once I stopped for water and walked for fifty or sixty metres. Then, finished! She took the lead. But then, near the end of the race, my ego came forward so powerfully, and I passed her.

The problem always starts when you drink. Good runners don't drink. If you drink, you are finished! You lose distance, and then for forty or fifty metres you feel miserable.

In today's race X very nicely surrendered. First she gave me a fight for one or two miles. Then I went ahead of her. I am so bad. Each time somebody was about to pass me, I looked around to see if X was coming. If I saw that X was not coming, I felt I was safe.

In the New Jersey marathon last week it was she who did not want to be behind me. She would increase her speed if I started to come up behind her. This time it was my turn to look around to see if she was coming.

I always say that the past is dust. In my case the past is gold. For inspiration I was watching a videotape of my best seven-mile race performance in Connecticut on 30 March 1980. That day I ran at a 7:19 pace. So the past for me is not dust; it is gold.

Five minutes before the race, Wally brought me a cup of coffee and I got strength from it in the beginning of the race. But later on it stopped working.

One man ran next to me. He was Mohan's brother-in-law. He gave me drinks along the way. Then he went ahead of me at the last moment. At the end, after finishing, he congratulated me.

At least ten times Jim Roser spoke to me during our twenty-four-hour race. I have never seen a runner who encouraged me so much. He was so nice. He was always cheerful and always had something nice to say. Once he said that he wanted to pronounce my name correctly because so many people were pronouncing it incorrectly.

At one point Nathan Whiting-the one with the long hair-said to me, "You do so many things."

I said, "I can't run."

He said, "So what? So many other things you are doing."

When I stopped to take rest, he said, "Everybody needs rest." He is very kind-hearted.

Dave Peabody, the tall man, is also very nice. He shook my hand.

Norman Allen ran with Beverly Nolan the whole way. He was calling himself "Beverly's friend." He wouldn't say his real name to the counters. He is a real joker. He was asking the counters to count Beverly's mileage and his mileage together so they would come in first. Tarak is also a joker. At one point, he was also calling him "Beverly's friend," instead of using his real name.

When I was running my last six miles during the twenty-four-hour race, I was going ahead of everyone, no matter which runner I came near. But I said to myself, "O God, some of them have run almost a hundred miles and I have run only twenty-two."

At one point I was behind Yasu. Poor fellow, he was holding his left leg, the hamstring. He was getting cramps. I prayed to God to give the cramp to me immediately, but God didn't listen to my prayer. My prayer was sincere. I said, "Let me suffer and let him go." He was only one metre ahead of me. I felt miserable, but God didn't listen to my prayer. So I went on.

At one point both Peter and Tulasi were asking people at the water stations if they had water, but they had run out.

Kurt Steiner likes me so much because we help the New York Road Runners Club in so many ways. Two or three times during the race he mentioned my name over the loudspeaker. When I finished, he mentioned my time. Niriha was standing with him on the platform taking video. She says that she helped him practise saying my name.

Yesterday afternoon around three o'clock I asked Vinaya to watch me while I did hill work on 150th Street. He is a good guard, except that he sometimes falls asleep when he is on duty. But this time he was wide awake.

At the bottom of the hill I saw a boy about thirteen or fourteen years old waiting for the Q-44 bus. The boy looked right at me and said out loud, "I don't know why everybody makes such a fuss about him. I don't see anything in him."

There was absolutely nobody else there only he and I. So I looked at him and said, "I don't see anything in you either."

Then he was really embarrassed and he turned away. I smiled at him and started running back up the hill.

The boy was very brave to say what he did, and I was also brave. He didn't walk away; he just turned around and looked at the fence, still waiting for the bus. By the time I went down the hill a second time, the bus had arrived and he had gotten on it. So I didn't have to encounter him again.

My oldest long-distance running route I discovered by myself. No one on my road crew found it. On this route I go down Union Turnpike to Springfield Boulevard and then to Northern Boulevard, and back. When I first used to take this route, instead of going back to Springfield and home along Union Turnpike, I would forget to turn and keep going straight along Northern Boulevard. Many times I would get lost.

I would be only one or two blocks away from Union Turnpike, and I would start asking people where Union Turnpike was. Sometimes I would have to go back on Northern Boulevard to Springfield because I couldn't find Union Turnpike.

Once I was actually standing on Union Turnpike and I asked someone whereUnion Turnpike was. My mind was so exhausted from my long run that day!

When you have to lose weight, it is no joke. Today I took only four hundred calories and ran fifteen and a half miles-only to lose weight.

Usually I weigh more after I finish running than I did before I started. This time I decided to catch the culprit! Before I went out, I weighed my ERG bottle when it was full. It weighed one pound and three ounces. Then I subtracted the weight of the bottle-an ounce and a quarter. From now on after I run I will know how much I have gained from drinking.

After running our four-mile race, I ran the ten-kilometre or 6.2-mile Foliage Run in New Jersey. The course had good mile markers and it was very beautiful. The trees on both sides of the road gave shade and created a soothing atmosphere. These kinds of races are really good. Sometimes in the races with thousands of people you get lost.

The only problem was that at times the course was dangerous because of the cars. Even near the finish line two cars were driving in front of me and not allowing me to go by them. At another place there was a parked car and the runners couldn't make a turn properly. Of course, this is because of the speed we were maintaining. The race officials were very careful that the front runners were unobstructed.

Also, there were many hills on the course-practically mountains. At one point, I walked about fifty metres up a very steep hill. I didn't dare run up it. Everybody else was also walking.

One child about ten years old was competing with me mile after mile. He was not running; he was dancing and jumping. I didn't see his feet touching the ground!

Then he saw a little girl who was younger than he was go ahead of us and his ego came forward. He could not bear it. He ran very fast to go ahead of me and catch her. Then he saw that she had stopped; she had surrendered. After fivemiles the little boy himself surrendered and I didn't see him anymore.

When I am running and old people go ahead of me, I say, "How can they do that?" I forget that I too am old.

One old man finished the race and then he went back to run with his wife. His wife was only five metres ahead of me when he came to join her at about the five-and-a-half-mile point. I finished a little ahead of her. When she finished, she was breathing so hard that she was practicably screaming. She sounded as if she were dying.

Like me, Sarama should have come to the Foliage Run after running our four-mile race this morning. She would have got another prize in her age group. This morning she was lucky because Ilona did not come; she was dreaming-fast asleep. Or perhaps Ilona had some bad injury or she had to go to work. Otherwise, she can defeat Sarama.

After the Foliage Run the officials were making announcements for runners to turn in their place cards. My card was just sitting on the grass near me. Finally Pahar saw it and went to return it. So I was one of the culprits in that respect. But they were not waiting for the place card of finisher number 236-me. They were waiting for the cards of some of the top runners.

* My Pacer-Coach

My coach, Pahar, ran with me today to pace me during the ten-kilometre race. I was running and he was jogging. Pahar is often my pacer for distances from one mile to twenty-six miles. But when I was his age I could definitely have defeated him. He is not an eleven-second sprinter. His timing for one hundred metres is fourteen seconds. In my entire athletic career I never ran the hundred so slowly! I started with twelve seconds and then improved. Of course, I was running without shoes-farmer's feet-on a cinder track. Otherwise, my timing would have been better.

After the Foliage Run I went into a bakery to buy prasad for all my helpers. The shopkeeper had a good soul. I asked her to put four pastries in one box and six in another. She said, "Yes, I will do it. I am pretty good in counting."

I said, "Only last week when I was in Woodstock a lady gave me less than what I had paid for."

The shopkeeper laughed and laughed. Then she gave me seventy-six cents change. I gave it back to her and said, "This is for you."

She said, "This is awfully kind of you. I have been working here for five years, and I have never gotten any tips. You are such a nice man."

Before I ran this morning, I weighed 136 1/2 pounds. Then, after running both our four-mile race and the ten-kilometre New Jersey race, how much did I weigh? 138! I gained almost two pounds. And what did I have to eat all day? Only ERG and one piece of pizza. Bad luck!

In the beginning of the Schaeffer five-mile run in Flushing Meadow this morning, I was standing right beside a man who was wearing one of our T-shirts, but he didn't know who I was.-11 October 1981

This morning when I was running, after about four miles I saw Nishtha and Savita. They were standing with folded hands. After I had completed five miles, I saw Lavanya and Nilima coming up the hill from Union Turnpike. But today I was not planning to run with anybody because I wanted to run ten miles.
