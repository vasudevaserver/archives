My Lord,
How can I satisfy You
All the time?

"My child,
Just ask your mind
To walk forward
Slowly and steadily.
Just ask your heart
To dive inward
Speedily and unreservedly.
That is all.
This is the only way
You can please Me all the time."

Playing with His friends
In the world-garden.
He has established His Oneness

When His children play
The game of multiplicity
Inside the heart-home of unity.

The human in him
Laughs and laughs
At his previous realisation-heights,
While the divine in him
Reveals a compassion-flooded Eye.

Who says he is
A hopeless and useless seeker?
He definitely has at least
One good quality.
Otherwise he would not be able
To follow any spiritual path.
Indeed it is his
Superb perseverance-quality
That keeps him alive
In the spiritual life.

When you read the ancient scriptures,
It is like appreciating
The beauty and the power
Of the ocean and the sky
At a great distance.
But if a spiritual Master
Comes to you
As the ocean and the sky,
It is your sole task
To fly into the sky
And dive into the ocean.

A supremely pure heart exists.

In God's own Way.

The same kind of pure heart,
But let us sincerely and sleeplessly
Strive for it.
We shall, without fail, succeed.
