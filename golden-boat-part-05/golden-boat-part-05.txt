DO THE GODS FEEL SORRY?

Do the gods feel sorry?
Yes, they do.
Why?
Because men surpass them.

Does God feel sorry?
Yes, He does.

Because most men
Do not dare to play with Him,
Let alone compete with
Or surpass
Him.

MOTION AND REST

Motion and rest
Complete God's Game.
Motion and rest
Are two brothers.

Rest prepares;
Motion distributes.
Rest dives deep within;
Motion flies far without.

In rest God dreams
His Reality-life.
In motion God becomes
One and inseparable
With His Dream-fulfilled Boat.

The immensity of God's Depth
And
The infinity of God's Height.
After the long inner struggle
He sees the meaning of life,
He feels the meaning of light.

WHEN I CONFIDE

When I confide my secrets
To my mind,
My mind betrays me
In a jungle of confusion.

When I confide my secrets
To my vital,
My vital throws me
Into a tornado of destruction.

When I confide my secrets
To my heart,
My heart takes me
To my soul
For special guidance.

And when I confide my secrets
To my soul,
My God-Goal immediately
Runs towards me.
