#+BEGIN_VERSE

When the sun appears in the East,
I make friends with my poetry.
I see a golden disc
Right above the blue sea.
A red hibiscus is smiling at me.
Is there anybody on earth, O Sun,
Who does not long for your smile?
No, nobody.
Everybody wants your smile.
I, too, want your smile
And something more:
I want to bow to you
With my heart’s adoration.

My Beloved, I love you.
For you I have brought
A few beautiful flowers
That I have collected early in the morning.
I wish to adore you with these flowers.
Ah, you are smiling at me because you know
That these flowers actually belong to you.
I am decorating you with your own gifts.

I am wasting my time in sports and fun.
O Lord, I know not when I shall call You.
Only a life of amusement satisfies me.
No knowledge have I, no intelligence have I;
Therefore, everybody calls me a fool.
Alas, they also do something more unthinkable:
They despise my innocent stupidity,
My innocent ignorance.

In a dark room
A small candle is burning.
No intelligence, no wisdom;
What I have is only eyeless pride.
The ignorance-soul in me thinks and feels
That nobody is as wise as it is
And it always speaks of its own existence —
All in hyperbole.

And be around Her for Her Compassion.

We shall offer Her flowers of devotion.

The river is flowing towards the sea,

It hopes that one day, O Lord,
You will appear before it,
For everywhere,
In the hill and the forest,
   In everything
Your Compassion-Light reigns supreme.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

Just because I was not born
In the government mint,
Everybody calls me a counterfeit coin.
Alas, if by mistake somebody gets me,
He does not keep me in his pocket, in his wallet;
He waits for a golden opportunity
     To get rid of me.
Nobody wants me, yet I move from one to another.
Sometimes people get annoyed with me,
They throw me into one corner of the room
And strike me again and again.
If only I was not a false coin.
     Ah, there comes a time
When my fate changes for the better.
I take shelter in a pious man,
A religious, spiritual man.
He finds it beneath his dignity
To deceive the world with me, through me.
He never tries to offer me to anybody else.
He just places me in one corner of the room
And takes away all the insults
That were heaped upon me by others.
It is in his hands
That my false journey’s false hope
     Comes to a final end.

Since You have listened to me,
Do me this great favour:
Take away from me all fear
Of darkness, ignorance and death.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

Every day I carry countless messages.
Some are sad, sorrowful, unhappy;
Some are happy.
I fly in all directions
And the beggar and the King alike look for me.
Some cry the moment they get me,
While others smile.
Some throw me, cast me aside;
Some place me inside the very depth of their heart.
I bring to the child his mother's affection-letter.
Again, I bring the message of the King.
I bring letters of the sister's love and affection
for the little brother.
And although he does not know how to read,
He casts his glance on the paper
And his joy knows no bounds
That he has received a letter.
He places the concentrative power on it
And offers her tears of gratitude.
Finally he takes shelter in the elder brother's affection
When his elder brother writes his sister on his behalf.
Or the father sends an affectionate letter to the son
And the son's joy knows no bounds.
While observing me,
You have made me into a small existence-reality.
You call me only an envelope, but you should know
That it is I who roam from one place to another,
From one country to another.
Always I have the capacity to fly in the plane.
Darkness I see not,
Fear I see not,
Sorrow I do not have for my own existence.
But I identify myself with all and sundry.
In their happiness, in their joy
I am one.
How will it ever be possible for you
To pay your debt to me, O foolish humanity?

I desire many, many things.
I get nothing,
Yet I go on asking for my desires.
There will be no end to them;
My desires will remain deathless.
Forever I look for my own existence-reality
Inside the heart of darkness.
I know why all this happens.
It happens because I have no aspiration-light.
Alas, I want You not,
He whom I want is the professor of desires.
You bring me nectar and call me.
Alas, what I do is look for my desire-life
Here, there, everywhere; within and without.
My restless vital I am.
There is no peace of mind within me.
But there is something which is very strange:
I still long for You,
And You alone.

Come, Mother, come! Do forgive me.
Do give me peace of mind, do embrace me.
You are great
And I am helpless and hopeless;
Therefore, I strike You.
I know when the divine Hour strikes
You will come to me, but I am restless.
Do come to me, do not remain afar.
I shall adore You, worship You,
Inside the city of my heart.
Do come, Mother!

Right now Your Victory I cannot ask for.
Aspiration is still fast asleep inside me;

Do fulfil me, make me complete.
May Your Victory be proclaimed.
It is You who can smash asunder the bondage,
The finite that has bound me.

My hope is fulfilled today.
All my sufferings have come to an end.
Peace in silence and light smiles all around me.
In my heart’s garden
Beauty’s flower has blossomed today.
I know not why and how.
Indeed, this is the boon
Of Your unconditional Concern and
     Love-Light for me.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

In hundreds of ways You call me,
Yet I go away from You.
My worst fault is my sulking nature,
Which tortures me all day and night.
When Your Victory dawns
I feel it is the beginning of my defeat.
When anything divine dawns in me,
I feel it is the beginning of something
    undivine in me.
I know this is the only reason why within and without me
I see death’s destruction-dance.

Alas, I know perfectly well
That the weight of ignorance-night is extremely heavy
And hard is it to pierce its veil.
Yet there is something in me
That enjoys the pleasure
Of being constantly and ceaselessly tortured
   By ignorance-night.

Ghor timire nachi pran taranir majhi
Nutan alo sathe madhur amar prate
Abar prabhu dio dekha ei dharanir buke
Daki jena tomai mora nitya sukhe dukhe
Dur karo aj moder praner klanti mithya bhoy
Phanki diye cheyechhilam karte tomai joy

I wanted to conquer You through deception.
Lord, all Your Affection and Love
   I have squandered.
All human beings are blind.
Our heart-doors are closed.
We dance in darkness tenebrous.
O Boatman of my life-boat,
Do come to me with new light
In the golden and sanctified morning.
O Lord, do appear once more before me.
Here on earth may I invoke You once again
Through ever-new sorrows and delight.
Today especially, O Lord,
Drive away all falsehood and fear from me.
Alas, I wanted to conquer You through deception,
By deceiving You.

I shall now offer You my dream-world
And then become totally silent.
I am telling You frankly
That I am completely exhausted.
What I want from You is reality-light
And not a dream-world.
How long have I to keep the dream-world
In my mind?
Reality’s truth-world, do awaken
Inside the forest of my heart.
