Dyulok chariye nara narayan sparshila aji dhuli
Tar jaya gan chalo mora kari sakala karma bhuli
Bhakati janaye tushibo tahare amara tarun dal
Nishchita jani chalar pathere kare dibo jhalamal
Sagar parer bijoy mukut jatan kariya ani
Tar padatale sahas anane rakhibo se mani khani
Durbal boka ar chanchal kabhu mora nahi habo
Jibaner majhe kaj kare jabo shato shato naba naba
Tahar shakashe nai amader kono dukh laj khoy
Kakhano amara shudhu tare chhara karibona kare bhoy
Maner majhare tahar asan kothai patite pari
Tari tare chalo bhabi dibanishi chhele khela sab chhari
Tar jaya gan ek sathe mile gahibo amara sabe
Tahare na pele kono labh nai moder thakiya bhabe
Je pathe moder guru chalechen sei path anusari
Chalibo amara e tarun dal tar jaya gan kari
Kusumer mato phutiya thakibo bitari madhur gandha
Nirbak haye dekhibe sakale moder chalar chhanda
Swadeshe bideshe jabo mora tar bahiya nutan bani
Nijere janiya kakhano amara haibona keha mani
Dyulok chariye....

#+BEGIN_VERSE

God in human form
Descends from Heaven today
To touch and feel
The breath of earth-dust.
Comrades, His Victory
Let us proclaim, casting aside
All our world-responsibility-obligations.

O Lord Absolute,
We, the ever-blossoming souls,
Shall satisfy You with our
Oneness-devotion-breath-hearts.
We embody certainty's life
To surprisingly illumine
Our journey's birthless
And deathless course.

Lovingly, prayerfully and soulfully
We shall bring the Victory-Crown
From the Consciousness-Ocean-Beyond
And, with a brightness-splendour-smile,
Place it at Your Feet
With our softness-heart-care.

A poltroon-body, a dunce-mind,
A restlessness-vital
We never shall be.
We shall ever be found
In the newness-vortex
Of activities multifarious.

No sorrow, no diffidence,
No loss can torture us
Before Your blessingful, august Presence.
To none save You
Shall we offer our fear-surrender.

You to invoke
And place inside
Our mind's seraglio-cave,
Let us sleeplessly
Occupy our mind, shunning
All our childish games and pranks.

Together, in oneness-heart,
Your Victory we all shall proclaim.
You if we fail to receive and achieve,
Our earth-life will helplessly betray
Its utter worthlessness and uselessness.

Singing our Master's Victory-Song,
We, the ever-blossoming souls,
Shall walk along Eternity's Road
Blazed by His Divinity's Radiance-Feet.

Like fully blossomed flowers,
We shall distribute
Our sweet redolence-fragrance.
Speechless, the whole world will watch
Our journey's progress-march.

Your new Message we shall carry
To all climes, near and far.
We shall be self-discoverers;
Pride-victims we never shall be.

/Refrain/

God in human form
Descends from Heaven today
To touch and feel
The breath of earth-dust.
Comrades, His Victory
Let us proclaim, casting aside
All our world-responsibility-obligations.

O Summit-Soul supreme,
Your Compasson-Light we invoke
To keep our hearts
Eternally at Your Feet.

In all,
The lower than the lowest
And the higher than the highest,
You abide.
Sleeplessly Your Victory-Song
Resonates in the heart of Eden.

You are a perfect stranger
To superiority-inferiority-twins.
You are at once the chosen Haven
Of both penury and prosperity-possessors.

You are Your Life's Sweetness-Affection
To all souls that breathe on earth.
None can dare fathom
Your Compassion-Heart-Ocean.

To offer You our /raison d'Ä™tre,/
We are speeding towards
Your Infinity's Height,
Smashing asunder today
All the bondage-shackles
That will cross our path.

/Refrain/

God in human form
Descends from Heaven today
To touch and feel
The breath of earth-dust.
Comrades, His Victory
Let us proclaim, casting aside
All our world-responsibility-obligations.

To spread Your Compassion-flooded
Life-Transformation-Message-Light
Here on earth,
We shall offer our all,
Our very last breath.

Even if we fail to muster
A new supply of strength
At each hush-gap,
We, the ever-blossoming souls,
Shall not permit ourselves
To be name-fame-beggars.

While enjoying a short respite,
We shall sing Your Victory-Songs
And fly Your Victory-Banner
Upon the Himaloy-pinnacle.

A day shall dawn
When we, the ever-blossoming souls,
Only by virtue of
Your Compassion-Blessings,
Shall proclaim our world-conquest
To the four corners of the globe.

No iota of wealth You own;
Yet, all El Dorados at Your Feet.
O Lord Supreme,
Indweller of our hearts,
Your boundless Bounty
Permits You not to escape
Our stark mind-confines.

/Refrain/

God in human form
Descends from Heaven today
To touch and feel
The breath of earth-dust.
Comrades, His Victory
Let us proclaim, casting aside
All our world-responsibility-obligations.

If any bosom pines
To be our compatriot,
Then presto! Renounce your all,
Your world-pleasure-plethora.

When all world-attachments leave you,
We shall welcome you
To join our group
With ever-widening open arms.

The rich and the poor,
The wise and the ignorant --
All those who inhabit the world --
In each and every human being
We shall see the living Presence of God,
Like our Master-Guru.

If ever we become pride-victims,
We know for certain
That Your infinite Compassion-Treasure
Will desert us.

We, the ever-blossoming souls,
Must be extremely careful
In preserving
Our newness-strength indomitable.

/Refrain/

God in human form
Descends from Heaven today
To touch and feel
The breath of earth-dust.
Comrades, His Victory
Let us proclaim, casting aside
All our world-responsibility-obligations.

He whom the holy saints
And honesty-flooded souls
In perfect amity worship,
And the single-minded devotees
Invoke to claim as their own,

He has taken human form
In the heart of Mother Bengal.
In His happiness
Our hearts must rejoice.
In His sadness
Our hearts must suffer.

To each and every soul,
Smiling we shall offer
Our hearts' newness-strength.
We, the ever-blossoming souls,
Shall dive deep
Into the Heart of Infinity's Light.

O Lord Absolute,
Today do inundate our earth-existence
With Your Compassion-Flood.
May our devotion-adoration
Ever be found
At Your Feet Supreme.

O Transcendental Height,
O Beauty Unfathomable,
To You we bow.
May we be totally oblivious
To our earthly gains and losses
In committing ourselves
To Your Service-Light.

/Refrain/

God in human form
Descends from Heaven today
To touch and feel
The breath of earth-dust.
Comrades, His Victory
Let us proclaim, casting aside
All our world-responsibility-obligations.

O Lord of the ever-transcending Beyond,
You are discovered Self-amorous
In Your birthless and deathless Light.
At Your Feet
All utterly lost human souls
Have found their Peace-Haven.

Vishma, Dadichi, Arjuna, Drona,
Bhima, Abhimanyu
Were all indomitable hero-souls
Who walked Mother-Earth
With their loftiest tower-majesty-heads.

You have inundated us
With Your Blessings infinite.
By virtue of Your Blessings,
We, the ever-blossoming souls,
Shall equal those immortal souls
And run abreast with them.

O Lord, Your Consciousness
Pervades the sky
And the Himaloy-pinnacle-heights.
In darkness-caves
And in ocean-expanse
It sings and dances
In perfect oneness.

O Lord Absolute,
Pondicherry-Dweller,
The saints, sages and yogis
Every morn and every eve
Proclaim Your Victory
From all four corners of the globe.

/Refrain/

God in human form
Descends from Heaven today
To touch and feel
The breath of earth-dust.
Comrades, His Victory
Let us proclaim, casting aside
All our world-responsibility-obligations.

If ever others speak ill of us,
We shall never hurt their hearts
In return.

Knowing perfectly well
That the Absolute Lord Supreme abides,
In His living Presence, in all,
How can we ever torture
Any human life?

The way the Life-Force
Of our breath
Resides in us,
Exactly the same way
The Life-Force abides in all,
And accepts and endures
Each and every human being.

You are the Source
Of Brahma the Creator.
Before You we place
Our supplication, devotion
And adoration-surrender.

No iota of fear have we
While offering You
Our wee, puny and paltry gifts,
For we know
You are the Compassion-Lord
Of our motherless, fatherless, helpless life.
You are the Vision-Light
Of the whole universe.
You are our Eternity's only Friend.

/Refrain/

God in human form
Descends from Heaven today
To touch and feel
The breath of earth-dust.
Comrades, His Victory
Let us proclaim, casting aside
All our world-responsibility-obligations.

Like the most insignificant service
Rendered by the morning dew
To the ocean-surface,
We know our service to You
Is equally and unmistakably
Most insignificant.
Notwithstanding, lovingly
You accept our service-flames
To bless us
With Your bountiful Pride.

In fire and water,
In dust and atoms,
Seeing You, Your Meditation-Trance,
Many poets have depicted
Your immortal Beauty.

They are our pioneers.
We are walking along the same road
To reach Your hallowed Feet.
This beautiful morning
We are weaving the garland
Of our heart's message,
Prayerful and soulful:

"Victory, victory, victory
To Sri Aurobindo,
The Guru Supreme of the Universe!"
Sleeplessly and breathlessly
Repeating this incantation,
We shall become
Eternity's sweetness-purity-breath.

O Lord Supreme,
You have donned
An earthly cloak.
We place at Your Feet
Our surrender unconditional
For Your unhorizoned Manifestation
Here on earth.

/Refrain/

God in human form
Descends from Heaven today
To touch and feel
The breath of earth-dust.
Comrades, His Victory
Let us proclaim, casting aside
All our world-responsibility-obligations.
