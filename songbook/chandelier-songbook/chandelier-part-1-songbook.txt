#+BEGIN_VERSE

Each of her spiritual children
Thought of her differently,
Spoke of her differently,
Saw her differently,
Loved her differently,
Judged her differently.
To each she represented
    Something else.
But one sweet fact they all affirmed:
“To see her is to own her.”

#+BEGIN_VERSE

Although I teach, I am the cap of fools;
Although I love all souls, a fiend am I.
I am not strong, yet for the weak I fight;
At will I sell myself and myself I buy.
At every pause my life I contradict.
To me are ever the same all truths and lies.
To me the earthly beings and He are one.
We fly in His Bosom vast, in us He flies.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

A sea of Peace and Joy and Light
    Beyond my reach I know.
In me the storm-tossed weeping night
    Finds room to rage and flow.
I cry aloud, but all in vain;
    I helpless, the earth unkind!
What soul of might can share my pain?
    Death-dart alone I find.
A raft am I on the sea of Time,
    My oars are washed away.
How can I hope to reach the clime
    Of God’s eternal Day?
But hark! I hear Thy golden Flute,
    Its notes bring the Summit down.
Now safe am I, O Absolute!
    Gone death, gone night’s stark frown!

The soil of Eternity.

My Lord with my Spirit’s Key.

The Truth immutable is revealed;

My spirit aware of all the heights,
    I am mute in the core of the Sun.
I barter nothing with time and deeds;
    My cosmic play is done.

We believe and we hold that each man has the
potentiality of reaching the Ultimate Truth. We
also believe that man cannot and will not remain
imperfect forever. Each man is an instrument of
God. When the hour strikes, each individual soul
listens to the inner dictates of God. When man
listens to God, his imperfections are turned into
perfections, his ignorance into knowledge, his
searching mind into revealing light and his
uncertain reality into all-fulfilling Divinity.

I can help the greatest of all causes: good-will
among men and peace on earth.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

In order to have a free access to the integral planet,
you will have to be integral in yourself, to resonate
with the same inner process of realisation and
transformation. Planetisation of mankind requires,
ultimately, the self-transcendent man.

Mankind is now, as never before, faced by the

We are confident that the time is near when the Member States
of a great international Organisation will bring to it their voices

humanity in its progress towards world peace based on freedom.

We come with an open mind and an open heart.
We are not unaware of our limitations. We are a

United Nations, and we command no material
power or influence; our strength will depend
wholly on the moral content of our stand.
