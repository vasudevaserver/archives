DEATH-DANCE

I met God in Heaven.
He asked me
How I was.

I met man on earth.
He wanted me to tell
How he was.

I met Satan in hell.
He told me that he had
Adopted a new course of life:
He prays to God every day,
He meditates on God every day,
He even loves God every day.

I met myself in the doubt-tornado
Of my mind, lost all:
Death-dance within, without.

WHEN I APPRECIATE MYSELF

When I appreciate myself
Humanity ridicules me,
Divinity enlightens me.

Divinity tells me that
My appreciation-power
Is nowhere near my achievement-height.

Humanity tells me that
My 'whole' is but a big hole.

CAME AND LEFT

Great men came

And
Lost their vision.
The world is now treating
their blind souls.

Bad men came
And
Lost their passports.
The world is now examining
their careless souls.
