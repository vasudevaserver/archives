My Lord,
I pray to You today
For a series of boons:
Do not fulfil my physical desires.
Do not fulfil my vital desires.
Do not fulfil my mental desires.
Do not fulfil my psychic desires,
For even my heart
Countless times desires wrong things.
Only fulfil the longings of my soul,
Which will never ask You
For what is uninspiring,
Unaspiring, unillumining
Or unfulfilling.
