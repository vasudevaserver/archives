Bharat Mata, Mother India,
My own Mother-heart-ambrosia.

Fulfilling the vision of the sages,
India, our Mother India,
With smiling face opens today
The door of Her Eastern Light.

Our Mother's body is not amputated.
She shines with divine beauty --
Though even now Her glow and grace
Are veiled by the clouds.

It is the festival of awakening of our Mother;
It is the dawn of a golden new era;
Our Mother is bringing for us Her casket
Filled with Her immortal gifts.

We shall bestow to the comity of nations, to the world at large
The sweet nectar of the Supermind.
We shall satisfy by the favour of our Mother
The hunger of all the souls.

The vision of Jesus Christ -- the Kingdom of Heaven --
In order to materialise,
Narayan is revealed today in man
On this earth of dust.

Victory of the Creator, victory of Bharatvarsha,
Victory of the dwellers of the universe
Is indicated today, and of the Golden Age
Today forms the dawn.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :GENRE: discourse
  :CITE-KEY: IMI:48
  :KEYWORDS:
  :END:


What is India's inner message to the world at large? Spirituality. What is spirituality? It is the natural way of truth that successfully communes with the Beyond here on earth.

What is India's absolutely distinctive possession? Her soul. She lives in the soul, she lives from the soul and she lives for the soul.

Where can the world find the real nature of India? In the ever-wakeful domain of the Spirit.

What has made the history of India unique? A most surprising and unusual continuity of the line of her spiritual seekers and Masters.

What does Indian spirituality teach? It teaches the world to conquer the evil of the lower nature and to go beyond the good of the higher nature.

What is Mother India's desire? It is to transcend the human way once and for all through radical self-transmutation, and to enter into the ever-dynamic Way of God.

Religion, however mighty it may be, is not and cannot be the message of India. Her message is Self-realisation.

The perfect truth of India's religion lies in its outer and inner realisation of the One that /is,/ of the One that is in the process of /becoming./

O world, on you march towards the deepest recesses of your heart! To your amazement, you will find Mother India to be anything but God-fearing. What then is she? She is God-loving: the God-loving soul in God's all-dreaming and all-manifesting Truth.

The soul of India feels that to be satisfied with intellectual speculation is to remain satisfied with only half of the food that is actually needed for health. It is realisation that gives one a full meal. And if one seeks realisation, meditation and concentration are of paramount importance.

Indian philosophy, in its most sublime sense, is nothing short of the practical realisation of the Truth.

There is no more than a hyphen between the Vision of the Vedic seers and the soul of India, and between India's spirituality and the final spiritual liberation of the world.



* India: Her consciousness and light -- Part II

  :PROPERTIES:
  :GENRE: discourse

  :KEYWORDS:
  :END:


They say that India long ago lost the Milky Way of greatness. But we know that she has now a colossal hope that the overcast sky will clear at last, revealing again myriad points of light.

What were the chief causes of India's downfall? She neglected the body-consciousness and eschewed the material life. She narrowed her outlook and sealed herself up in the outworn rituals of the past. She clung to the festering shell of her ancient culture and succeeded in killing its living, growing spirit. And India's doom was sealed the day she started these practices.

India began to rise the day she turned away from these tendencies and accepted life in all its dynamic aspects.

India will rise fully the day she becomes self-reliant. She knows well that she cannot achieve her goal if she has to depend permanently on alien help. Self-help is the best help. Self-help is God's own help in disguise.

India has within her a voice that is the self-same, all-fulfilling Voice of God. That Voice she simply must hear and obey.

What is actually meant by the emancipation of the Indian woman? It means that she must no longer be alienated from education. She must have free access to the worldwide knowledge of the present day, in addition to the sacred lore of past centuries. True education helps us to live in the integral perfection which is the very backbone of our existence on earth. The Indian woman must be given full opportunity to develop and manifest this perfection.

The emancipation of the Indian woman also means that she must not be suppressed and dominated by man. She must be free to be herself, independent in her own right, strong and confident, a true partner and companion of man and not his drudge and serf. She must become again what she was in Vedic India, a respected and equal citizen, a glorious complement to man.

Today's India is poverty-stricken. But tomorrow's India will be prosperous. She will be a mighty wave of hope and faith. Her very thought will be stirred with a new vision. Infinite will be the possibilities on her horizon. Her sacrifice will build a more durable foundation for mankind. She will contain within herself nationalism and internationalism, becoming the true symbol of spirituality in action.

India, with her spiritual power, will wield a tremendous influence on future generations. This is no imagination, but vision in operation.

India and India alone is the nerve centre of the aspiring world.

India's strength is not in her arms, but in her heart. More so, it is in her seer-vision.

India tells the world that the realisation of unity is the only strength which can conquer the world.

India is a seeker of the Absolute. The /summum bonum/ of life is the ideal of God-realisation. In her heart there is a burning love of God; in her mind, the service of unawakened humanity.

Consumed with desires and temptations, Europe rushed towards India to acquire her fabulous wealth. That is true. But it is equally and absolutely true that Europe's soul came to India with a spiritual seeking and an occult urge to discover what India was actually like.

India has three world-conquering weapons: non-violence, peace and the wisdom which tells that she is in all as all is in her.

India's choice is character. But she must feel that she needs personality as well.

Mother India's fear is not of atomic bombs but of her children's self-forgetful amnesia.

Unbelievably, India has perfectly reconciled in herself the two worst antagonists: renunciation and epicurianism.

Perfection was the choice of the Greeks. Proportion was the choice of the Romans. Universality is the choice of the Indians.

India's is the voice that never falters. Hers is the truth that cannot be silenced by the threatening darkness of centuries. Hers is the heart that sings perpetually of the unity of mankind.

India is the vault of an ancient, eternal wisdom that has a universal appeal. She is also the universal reserve bank of an ever-growing wisdom, and she is destined to be the hub and dynamo of world transformation.

The Vedic seers saw the Truth with their souls, in their Heavenly visions and in their earthly actions.

/Satyam eva jayate nanritam/

"Truth alone triumphs, not falsehood." This Truth teaches us how to be true brothers of mankind, conscious and devoted lovers of God and perfect masters of nature.

Each Vedic seer is a poet and a prophet. In the case of an ordinary poet, his poems are quite often based upon imagination. In the case of the Vedic poets, it was intuition that gave birth to their poems. This intuition is the direct knowledge of Truth.

The great sage Bhrigu was also an astrologer of the highest magnitude. He wanted to know for certain who was the most compassionate among the three principal cosmic gods: Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. So he went to Brahma's house without permission and entered like an intruder. Then he spoke roughly with Brahma. Brahma became furious.

Bhrigu left and went to Shiva's house. He forced open the door and started unjustly criticising Shiva. Shiva's anger is of the quickest. He was about to turn the sage into ashes, but the sage left and went to Vishnu's house. Vishnu was fast asleep, lying on his back. Bhrigu placed his right foot on the middle of Vishnu's chest. Vishnu opened his eyes and to Bhrigu's utter amazement, caught his leg and soulfully began massaging his foot. "I am so sorry," Vishnu said. "Are you hurt?" Immediately the sage came to understand which god is the most compassionate of the three.

Agastya is very well known in South India. It was he who brought science and literature to that part of India. It was he who introduced Tamil grammar. He excelled in astrology, magic, sorcery and many things.

He revealed the ideal of perfection in a human being. He revealed His Enlightenment and Compassion in a divine being. Lord Buddha cast aside caste. The fallen learned from Him the value of self-respect. The unbending learned from Him the necessity of humility.

True, Buddhism is no longer alive in the land of its birth, but Mother India is abundantly proud of Her spiritual Prince, and She ever cherishes Her world-illumining Teacher. Her fondest feeling is: My Buddha is a rebel Child. My Buddha is a great Contributor. My Buddha is a great Reformer.

Without God, both man and the world are meaningless futility. Man can be released and will be released from the meshes of ignorance one day and is bound to realise God.

Nothing can be done on earth without God's immediate Concern, direct Approval and express Command from the inner planes. The Supreme Will of the Supreme guides the world. It pilots the world to its destined goal. Man can be free from the shackles of ignorance only when it is the Will of the Supreme. Liberation is not only possible, but inevitable.

The absolute surrender of Miss Margaret Noble at the feet of an Indian sannyasin stands as a glorious proof of the submission of the West before the spiritual Light of India.

She successfully utilised the power that she received from her Master in the cause of uplifting Indian womanhood and of freeing the Indian nation from foreign yoke. This again proves that as the East is endowed with the power of imparting spirituality, even so, the West possesses the power of receiving it.

No Indian will ever deny the important role that she played after entering into the Indian political fray.

Sri Aurobindo's Truth is the Seed. His Law is the Plant. His Forgiveness is the Tree. His Holocaust is the Fruit -- the Supermind for the world's transformation.

The Mother is ceaseless forgiveness. It is man's bulwark against perdition.



* Sri Aurobindo's Integral Yoga

  :END:


A Seer-Poet to the poets, a divine Philosopher to mankind, a Master Yogi to his worshippers, an Avatar to his disciples -- who is he? Sri Aurobindo.

Sri Aurobindo's Yoga is an ambrosial consciousness with infinite possibilities; it is a never-tiring march, a decisive and everlasting victory of Truth.

The keynote of Sri Aurobindo's Integral Yoga is evolution -- evolution of consciousness in and through Matter. There is no shadow of doubt that Matter and Spirit are one. Spirit, when it is fast asleep, is Matter; Matter, when it is fully awakened, is Spirit.

Integral Yoga is founded on an all-fulfilling experience which is anything but speculation and reasoning. An Integral Yogi is he who has seen all the phases of existence and whose very life is full of variegated experiences and realisations.

A marvel-idealism and a highly practical divinity are housed in Sri Aurobindo. His are the experiences that may serve as humanity's royal road to a life worth living -- a life of the Spirit, the Life Divine.

Sri Aurobindo holds that physical work is in no way a bar to spiritual progress. On the contrary, he strongly feels that physical work is an aid to self-preparation for the full manifestation of the Divine both in oneself and upon the earth.

Sri Aurobindo tells the world that it is not only possible but entirely practicable to work easily, incessantly, consciously, inwardly, outwardly, thus finally successfully. And in his opinion, life itself is a blessing of God through which man has to realise Him and be one with Him.

Sri Aurobindo's is the supernal Smile that reveals at once the embodiment of an infinite achievement and the future spiritual destiny of mankind.

Invisible to the blind, yet invincible to the strong, and a wonderful practical hope to the four corners of the globe, is the power of Sri Aurobindo's Integral Yoga.

Sri Aurobindo is the ever-creative silent bridge between God's Will and His Fulfilment.

In Integral Yoga, God-realisation means merely standing at the shore of the vast sea of Consciousness. The fire-pure change of the inner and outer life means swimming in that sea. Manifestation of the Divine on earth means returning Home after having crossed the sea, bringing with you the Golden All.

It is not a dream of God but His Decree that Heaven and earth must fall supremely in love with each other. He wants their marriage to take place sooner than immediately. Earth feels that she is inferior to Heaven. Heaven feels that he is superior to earth. And because of their mutual hesitation, the day of their marriage is kept in abeyance.

Integral Yoga has made a significant choice. It wants not only to see and feel the conscious evolution of life, but also to embody a fully harmonised life of Matter and Spirit.

An Integral Yogi is he who sacrifices his life to become a bridge between earth and Heaven. He has foregone Heaven; he uplifts earth.

The aspirant in man is the cross-bearer. The Yogi in man is the crown-bearer.

To say that Yoga is the realisation of God is not to say all. Yoga is the living union with God by self-affirmation and self-abnegation.

Sri Aurobindo tells us that God-realisation never obliges us to kill all feelings, to make our heart a sterile wasteland and to pronounce a curse on the world. God is everything and in everything.

Readiness in Integral Yoga amounts to an aspiration that wishes to be expressed. Willingness amounts to an aspiration that has already been expressed.

An unprecedented teaching of Integral Yoga propounded by Sri Aurobindo is that man can have material prosperity alongside his spiritual development.

Give an ordinary man ten dollars. He will immediately wonder what he can buy with it to make life more pleasant. Give a sannyasin ten dollars. He will try to avoid taking it or else find some means by which he can do without it. Give an Integral Yogi ten dollars. Since he has neither attachment to nor repulsion from money, he will try to utilise it as a divine trustee.

To be unconscious of a spiritual opportunity is to starve one's spiritual destiny.

Difficulties in the Integral Yoga never indicate one's unworthiness. Behind each difficulty there is a possibility, nay, a blessing in disguise, to accept the test boldly and to come out successfully.

In Yoga, all reactions are threatening but passing clouds. Human aspiration is the naked and permanent sword of the soul to stab through the weakness of human nature and rise triumphant on the ashes of its conquests.

Follow no other ideal than to materialise the power of perfection on earth.

Sri Aurobindo's Yoga is the tallest mango tree. His disciples and followers have to climb right up to the top of the tree and bring the mangoes down to earth. For if the fruit is taken at the top, it tastes sour; if taken at the foot of the tree, it tastes delicious.

What is the meaning of coming into contact with God? It means that we shall become one with His universal Existence. As after marriage a woman automatically possesses her husband's name, home and wealth, even so, after our union with God we shall infallibly become one with His all-fulfilling Nature. Verily, in that Divine Hour we shall hear Sri Aurobindo's soul-stirring voice:

"We are sons of God, and must be even as He."

If we do not enter into the spiritual life, if we do not pay attention to the inner life, then the body is bound to act like a mad elephant, trampling down everything around us. This very body, however, really wants to respect its superiors, the heart and the soul. This body wants to be the perfect instrument. When we use the body for the sake of enjoyment, sense-pleasure, only to covet, to enjoy, we are misusing the body. We are giving no importance to the soul. At this point we can well think of the great spiritual Master named Ramana Maharshi, a great yogi. "Why do you pay so much attention to the body? Take it as a banana leaf. Eat your meal, which is placed on the banana leaf, and then after you have eaten, just throw away the banana leaf. It has played its part." Again, if we observe the Truth from another angle, we see that if we discard the body as a banana leaf, seeing it only as a covering for the soul, then how can manifestation take place here on earth?

Once, the great sage Vyasa was deeply inspired to write an epic, but he found that it was impossible for him to write down the whole epic. So he prayed to Brahma, the Creator, and Brahma descended in human form. The sage said to Brahma, "Please send me someone who can write down what I say." Brahma said, "Well, there is only one person on earth who can do that, and that is Ganapati. He can take down your dictation." So Vyasa invoked Ganapati, the son of Lord Shiva.

Ganapati came and agreed to write on one condition. The condition was that Vyasa could not pause; he had to dictate continuously, without interruption. If he hesitated or if he paused, then Ganapati would leave him. Vyasa consented and said, "Now, I also want to dictate to you on one condition, and that condition is, that unless and until you know the meaning of what I dictate you will not write. You have to wait and ask me if there is anything that you do not comprehend."

Thus, India's unparalleled epic, the Mahabharata, was composed.

He wrote his plays and poems in Sanskrit. His most beloved epic poem is /Megha Dutam/, "The Cloud-Messenger."

Kalidasa lived during the reign of a good, kind, benevolent and powerful king named Vikramaditya. To encourage inspiring, illumining and divine activities in his court, he appointed nine extraordinary figures, who were known as /navaratna/, the nine gems. They were experts in various fields, such as medicine, astronomy, painting and so on. Kalidasa happened to be one of those nine gems. He was the /asthana kavi/, the poet of the royal court.

Kalidasa received wisdom-light from Mother Kali; that is why his name was Kalidasa -- the servant of Mother Kali.

When his boyhood was just commencing to bud into adolescence, countless coloured images rocketed in the sky of his imagination for a swift flare-up into fame.

From his adolescence he was consumed with the desire to be an out-and-out Englishman. According to him, Bengal, nay the whole of India, was sadly wanting in the capacity of appreciating a genius, whereas the free thinking of foreigners could evaluate real merit....

To our joy, Madhusudan realised his mistake. He wrote to his friend Gour from France: "If there be any one among us anxious to leave a name behind him, and not pass away into oblivion like a brute, let him devote himself to his mother-tongue. That is his legitimate sphere -- his proper element."

They offered a 10,000-rupee award to anyone who could tell them about Surya Sen.

Either because of money, or out of jealousy, one of Surya Sen's relatives told the British that Surya Sen was at his house. As a result, the police came and captured him. On January 12th, 1934, before the sun rose, Chittagong's sun, India's sun, was hanged.

J. C. Bose the seer was as great as J. C. Bose the scientist. He represented a novel type in the world of science. He was the forerunner of a new age of scientific research. He had moved the frontiers of intuitive science towards a fresh attainment. A man of deep faith, a perfect example of artless living and lofty thinking, an embodiment of all that is good and inspiring was Jagadish Chandra.

/Sarvam prana ejati nihsrtam/ (Everything springs up from life and makes movements therein). This eternal message of the Upanishads ceaselessly reverberated in the inmost recesses of the discoverer of "plant sensitivity." The world has come to learn from this son of India the secret of observing a plant shivering, suffering, struggling, perhaps even reciprocating love.

Tagore, the international figure, poet, artist and mystic, is an everlasting name. Prafulla Chandra Ray's contribution to the world of chemistry is magnificent.

He received his Ph.D. from Edinburgh University and, as a teacher of chemical science, had many pupils who later became great world chemists. When once asked if he had any children, he responded with a list of seventy-three of his dearest and brightest students.

Possession is no satisfaction, so long as ego breathes in us. The great King Janaka knew it. No wonder Janaka was loved by the sage Yagnyavalkya most.

So, what happened? Mithila, Janaka's capital, began to burn in mounting and devouring flames. The disciples left their preceptor and hurried to their respective cottages. What for? Just to save their loin cloths! All fled save Janaka. He ignored his riches and treasures burning in the city. Janaka stayed with his Guru, Yagnyavalkya, listening to the sage's ambrosial talk.

/"Mithilayam pradagdhayam namekincit pranasyati/ -- Nothing do I lose even though Mithila may be consumed to ashes." Now the disciples came to learn why their Guru favoured Janaka most.

From the highest spiritual point of view, we cannot welcome Kunti Devi's wisdom. Nevertheless, it served her purpose most effectively. True, sorrow purifies our emotional heart. But the divine Light performs this task infinitely more successfully. Yet one has not to be afraid of sorrow's arrival in one's life. Far from it. Sorrow has to be transformed into joy everlasting.

India's past is remarkably rich and varied. The same can be said of Her dauntless present, which can and must provide a starting point for the golden future.

Our /Bharat Mata/ always beckons the length and breadth of the world. She inspires the seekers. She elevates the consciousness of those who sincerely thirst for a higher life, a life of illumination and perfection.

India, in its purest sense, is neither a matter-hungry nor a world-shunning country.

An indomitable will is energising /Bharat Mata./ Progress, both material and spiritual, is being effected with lightning speed.

India is the land of surrender. This surrender is not a blind submission, but rather the dedication of one's limited self to one's unbounded Self.

It is easy to insist that the India of the past was sublime while the India of today is anything but that. But they are mistaken who think that ancient Hinduism is the only part of Indian life worth studying. India's present, too, has much to contribute to the world at large. Her soul's light, paying no heed to outer recognition, is playing an important role in awakening the heart of the world, and it is ultimately destined to inspire humanity with the message of truth, forgiveness and universal kindness.

The present-day world is consciously longing for unity. Hinduism teaches that India's unity is Her oneness of spiritual vision, Her integral fulfilment. Humanity is becoming convinced of the truth that the material, intellectual and spiritual lives can indeed run abreast to achieve the final Victory of God here on earth.

The ancient Romans saw religion as a force which binds and controls man. But the ancient Indian seers felt that religion, nay, /dharma,/ must release man from that which binds him, that is, his own ignorance. Man's awakened consciousness must do away with ignorance, or to be precise, must transform ignorance into the knowledge of Truth.

India's spiritual heart knows how to accept other religions, how to appreciate other religions and how to admire other religions. India's spiritual heart has realised that for each new religion there is a new approach to the Goal. Each path is right and indispensable for its own followers.

Hinduism gives due importance to all the spiritual figures of the world. It recognises a great harmony in their teachings. Down through the ages, the firmament of India has sent forth the message of peace, love and truth. It has fostered and encouraged the synthesis of all world religions. Further, Hinduism has always affirmed that the highest end of life is not to remain in any particular religion, but to outgrow religion and realise and live in Eternal Truth.

Hinduism is the embodiment of certain lofty, infallible ideals. These ideals within us live and grow, grow and live. Because of this fact, Hinduism is still a living force. It lives to lead. It leads to live.

To know Hinduism is to discover India. To discover India is to feel the breath of the soul. To feel the breath of the soul is to become one with God.

The world surprisingly appreciates and astonishingly admires the spirituality-surges of Tibet. The world irrevocably adores and sleeplessly bows to the spirituality-ocean of India. As Hinduism is the tree and Buddhism is a branch thereof, even so, Indian consciousness is the fount of the Tibetan flow. India gave and became. India gave aspiration and became the service-smile. Tibet received and enriched. Tibet received benediction and enriched its silence-sound.

It is absurd to hold that the India of the hoary past played exclusively the role of world-renunciation. Our ancients accepted life in full faith. They clearly believed in life itself as a great power.

Our Vedic parents expressed their will to live a long, radiant life when they sang:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

#+END_QUOTE

"May we, for a hundred autumns, see
That lustrous Eye,
God-ordained, arise before us.

May we hold our heads high for a hundred autumns;
Yea, even beyond a hundred autumns."

#+END_VERSE

In full earnest, they tried to fathom and understand the mystery of life. They accepted the earth with all its joys and sorrows, its hopes and frustrations. Moreover, they wanted to live as the master and lord of life. They were therefore dauntless and uncompromising in their opposition to evil. They wanted their souls to be possessed absolutely by the Supreme and, at the same time, they aspired to serve Him in the world.

Mother India is an aspiring tree. This aspiring tree has the Vedas as its only root. The root is Truth, the tree is Truth, the experience of the tree is Truth, the realisation of the tree is Truth, the revelation of the tree is Truth, the manifestation of the tree is Truth.

The Rig Veda is the oldest of all the Vedas. This Veda embodies the earliest monument of India's aspiration and realisation. India's poetry, India's philosophy, India's literature, India's religion and India's science all owe their very existence to the Rig Veda, which is their source.

India's soul-offering is the perennial light of the Upanishads. The Upanishads offer to the world at large the supreme achievement of the awakened and illumined Hindu life.

Although outwardly the Indian people quarrel and fight, the light, the peace and the silence that we have received from the Vedic seers of the hoary past are working within us in our inner life. Outwardly many Indians are in constant conflict, but in the inner world they are in perfect harmony and they love their Source, God, most sincerely. So the inner message of India will always remain illumining and fulfilling.



* On India and the West

India wants to be. The West wants /to do/. Is it not at once safe and advisable /to be/ first, and then to offer one's contribution to the wide world? /"Atmanam viddhi/ -- Know thyself," says the Upanishad. "First know thyself, and then do thou proclaim thyself."

Prayer is one road and meditation is another road. In the East, in India, meditation is part and parcel of people's living existence, whereas prayer is part and parcel of people's living existence in the West. When we pray, we talk to God; and when we meditate, we listen to God.

Prayer and meditation can easily go side by side. In the West we hear more about prayer. In the East, especially in India, we hear more about meditation. Prayer and meditation should go together because they lead us to the same destination. Yet they each have distinct qualities and capacities.

When we pray soulfully, we feel that something within us -- let us call it an inner cry -- is climbing high, higher, highest until it reaches the Feet of our Beloved Father Supreme. We also feel that our Heavenly Father, our Eternal Father, is listening to our prayer or is waiting for our cry to reach Him.

When we meditate, we feel that Something or Someone is coming down to us from Above, from the highest plane of consciousness. The Absolute Lord is descending in order to bless us and tell us what to do.

God is at once our Divine Father and our Divine Mother. In the West, God the Father is prominent, while in the East, in India especially, God the Mother comes first. Both East and West are perfectly right. When we realise God the Father, we are bound to see God the Mother within Him. When we realise God the Mother, we will unmistakably see God the Father within Her.

When we approach God the Father, we feel His Wisdom, His inner Light, His Vastness. When we approach God the Mother, we feel Her infinite Love, infinite Compassion, infinite Concern. It is not that God the Father does not have Compassion. He also has it. But God expresses Love, Compassion and Concern through the feminine form more than through the masculine form. In the masculine form He offers Wisdom, Light, Vastness.

In the West, we know that Christ, the Son of God, said, "I and my Father are one." In India, our Vedic seers said, /"Aham Brahmasmi/ -- I am the Brahman." On the strength of their highest realisation, they became the Truth itself. When Christ or the spiritual Masters say that they are God, they say it on the strength of their inseparable oneness with Him.

Matter is the pride of Europe. Spirit is the pride of India. Neither of the two can possess a complete satisfaction, for the former is in the dark about the potentialities of the Spirit, and the latter about the cogency of Matter. There can be no abiding happiness until Matter and Spirit are amalgamated into one Reality.

It has been delightfully claimed that: "Love in France is a comedy; in England a tragedy; in Italy an opera seria; and in Germany a melodrama." In the true Indian tradition love has always been a self-offering and a self-fulfilment.



* On India and America

For the last part of this century, the West has been aspiring most sincerely for the highest Truth. For the past three decades Indian spirituality has been coming here in waves. India has aroused America from her spiritual sleep. Americans were sleeping and Indian teachers have come and helped them.

Here in America, we are in the land of freedom, the freedom that nourishes dynamic thoughts and dynamic movements. There in India, we are in a land of freedom, the freedom of a fertile, tolerant spirituality that nourishes all religions. Here we wish to reach God by running speedily, while there we wish to reach God by climbing swiftly.

India's history is aglow with stories of kings and potentates who enjoyed power and opulence without being in the least attached to them. Rajarshi Janaka was not an isolated example. Prince Siddhartha, afterwards the Buddha, Emperor Asoka and Chhatrapati Shivaji are other such outstanding figures in India's history.

Of all the nations in the world today, America is the one which, in the modern context, stands forth uniquely as the one most fit for the ideal of Janaka, Siddhartha, Asoka and Shivaji. By the flow of her wealth, America has restored shattered Europe, not once but twice. Impoverished India has been helped towards her goal of achieving minimum conditions of life for her vast millions through large-scale and repeated American aid.

It is not only for political and economic purposes that the divine logic of events has brought India and America close together. What is visible in these external aspects of life will be seen in an incalculable measure on deeper levels in days to come. America is perhaps not conscious that in taking a major part in the economic rehabilitation of India she has been building up the base of a divine new world.

Life to the American consciousness is nothing short of completing one task after another with the hope of realising the all-liberating Freedom.

Life to the Indian consciousness is nothing short of completing one endeavour after another with the hope of realising the all-nourishing Peace.

Why does a particular soul take birth in a particular country? There are two basic reasons: either the soul has been commanded by the Supreme or the soul has a specific preference for that country. Why will a soul care for a particular country? It is because the soul has its own inner propensities. It feels that it has some intuitive capacity or other quality which can be easily brought into manifestation if it takes incarnation in a particular country. If a particular soul has dynamism, it will try to take incarnation in America, not India. Again, if it cries for inner harmony and peace, then it will try to take incarnation in India.

Both India and America, East and West, have something to give to the world. India is offering the message of peace and the West is offering the message of science. If the West had not given the East the message of science, India would have remained primitive. And if India had not brought an iota of light to the West, then the West would have remained unillumined. Whatever India and America have, each has to give to the other gladly. They are like two brothers in a family. If one brother is a doctor, he will give medicine. If another is an electrician, he will do electrical work. How can the doctor do the work of the electrician, or vice versa? In exactly the same way, whatever India has to offer to the world, the West must gladly accept; and whatever the West has to give, India has to accept. Then only, East and West can become complete.

Without India, America is incomplete; and without America, India is incomplete. But when they are together, when they are for each other, at that time they please the Absolute Supreme in His own Way. India is God the Vision, America is God the Mission. The union of Vision and Mission can alone bring about God the Satisfaction.

Nothing gives me greater joy than to hear that American brothers and sisters and Indian brothers and sisters have worked together for the fulfilment of one cause, one hope and one heart, in which all-loving, all-illumining and all-fulfilling oneness reigns supreme.

May India's aspiration-sky and America's rocket-speed together sing the supreme fulfilment-song of God-prosperity here on earth.

My God, the Supreme Musician, has two families. One is in the East, the other in the West. He tells His Eastern children, precisely His Indian children, that music is the soul's purity. He tells His Western children that music is life's beauty.

He tells His Eastern children that music is the fulfilling rest at the bottom of the life-sea. He tells His Western children that music is the dance of the multitudinous waves of the life-sea.

Most English songs are like geometry. Everything is measured -- English metre, English line. But we Indians have eternal time. It is like the Ganges flowing. Our flow is also eternal. And whenever we get the opportunity, we bring forward our classical tendencies, and we do not know when to start and stop; it just goes on. Once we are inspired, inspiration carries us, or we carry it or drag it! But English songs are like metric units -- here there will be a beat, a quarter note, this and that. But when we Indians start singing soulfully, we forget about beats and earthbound measurement; at that time we deal with Eternity's time. Eternity's time carries us along or we carry the inspiration with us.

There is a considerable difference between the Western approach and the Indian approach in the music world. No criticism; it is only a difference of taste.

/Bande Mataram/ (Mother, I bow to Thee):

This was the original national anthem of India, and the source of profound inspiration in the long struggle for India's independence.

No Indian will forget the role that this song, /Bande Mataram,/ played in the patriotic feeling of the Indian people. It served a divine purpose in energising them in their long struggle for freedom. From the burning hearts of India's patriots, its flames of incantation rose high into the sky.

It is my firm conviction that /Bande Mataram/ will keep Bankim's memory green for all time in this great sub-continent and will stand out in the future as the national Mantra that it is.

Of all the musical instruments, the conch is the most sacred and spiritual. Cosmic gods and goddesses hold the conch. Sri Krishna, Arjuna, and all heroes of the highest order used the conch. It is the symbol of victory. The conch is to be found on the sea bed. Water symbolises consciousness and the ocean symbolises vastness. In our spiritual life, nothing is more important than the expansion of our consciousness. A sacred, sacred, sacred instrument is our Indian conch.

* /Question:/ I would frankly like to know what India's spirituality has ever done for her. How is it that, in spite of her yogis and saints, she is still a poor and backward country?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :GENRE: qa
  :CITE-KEY: IMI:143

  :END:


First, we must understand what has brought this situation about. In ancient India, the material life was not renounced. People in those days aspired for a synthesis of Matter and Spirit, and to some extent they were successful in achieving it. But there is a great gulf between that hoary past and the present.

In the later periods of India's history, the saints and seers came to feel that the material life and the spiritual life could never go together, that they had to renounce the outer life in order to attain God. Hence, the external life was neglected. This led to foreign conquests and many other troubles. Even today, the attitude that material prosperity and beauty should be negated is very common in India. This accounts for much of her continued poverty.

But at present there are spiritual giants in India who feel that God should be realised in His totality, that Creator and creation are one and inseparable. They advocate the acceptance of life, the real need for both progress and perfection in all spheres of human existence. This new approach is widely accepted in modern India.

India may be poverty-stricken today, but she will progress quickly by virtue of her new awareness and her new aspiration. She has not only magnanimity of heart but also the power to bring her soul's strength to the fore and use it to solve all her problems.



* /Question:/ Do you feel that there is a revival of the principles of non-violence in our present-day world?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :GENRE: qa
  :CITE-KEY: IMI:144
  :KEYWORDS:
  :END:


The revival of non-violence is only in theory, not in practice. In India 2,500 years ago Lord Mahavira and Lord Buddha preached non-violence, and in those days they did practise it.

If India had continued to remain with her ancient heart-power and soul-power, eventually the Western world would have valued what India was offering. When there is something new or totally different, we may not value it at first. It may seem meaningless to us. But eventually we try to dive deep within to see if there is any reality in it.

Although the India of today may believe in non-violence in her soul, I do not feel that there is a sincere longing for peace in the heart, in the mind, in the vital and in the body. To our extreme sorrow, the present-day India is in no way better than the rest of the world in terms of restlessness and vital aggression.

Non-violence is not something that is on the physical plane only. It has to be found in the vital and in the mind. If the mind is clear of wrong thoughts, then there cannot be any violence. To clear the mind, to have an iota of peace in the mind, we have to practise the spiritual life.

From our spiritual life we will come to discover that there is something that is even more important than non-violence, and that is peace. Peace is like a peak in the Himalayas that is high, higher, highest. It has its origin in the Supreme Himself. Prayer and meditation can feed us with inner peace. This inner peace will inundate our soul, our heart, our mind, our vital and our body. But it is we who have to cultivate the inner hunger for peace. Without that hunger, it is impossible for the Supreme to feed us with His all-fulfilling Peace.

For me, there is no India, no America, no Europe; there is only God's House, God's Mansion, God's Palace. At one moment God may ask me to stay and work in a particular room of His House which is called America. The next moment He can easily tell me to go and work in another room which is called India. The following moment He may order me to go and work in England or Germany or some other place. My task is to accept His Command cheerfully, readily and willingly at every moment. My task is only to be at His Feet and surrender my very existence to Him unconditionally.

When I was born, my whole world was my father and mother. Then, when I grew a little older, my tiny village of East Shakpura was my whole world. Then my city, Chittagong, my province, East Bengal, and my country, India, became my whole world. Each time I became more awakened or developed, my consciousness expanded. Now if you ask me, "Where do you live?" the human in me will say, "I live in New York." But the divine in me will say, "No, I live inside the heart of aspiring humanity. My real home is inside the hearts of my spiritual brothers and sisters, just as they also live in my heart."



* /Question:/ You are able to combine the spirituality of India with Western dynamism. This is quite unheard of for a teacher of Indian spirituality. Do you follow a prearranged plan, or do you try to conform to the world while bringing good into it?

As the inner life is fruitless and useless without peace, even so the outer life is fruitless and useless without dynamism. According to me, India's spirituality lies in its inner peace, just as the Western world's progress lies in its outer dynamism. The dynamism of the West and the inner peace of the East must go together in order to bring about a world of perfect harmony and satisfaction.

I owe my aspiration-heart to India; I owe my dedication-life to America. I feel that the inner life of aspiration and the outer life of dedication are both needed in order to manifest the divine Light of our Heavenly Father here on earth.

I do not follow a prearranged plan. I just obey devotedly, soulfully and unconditionally the express Command of my Lord Beloved Supreme. In the beginning, I was absolutely puzzled and confused by the West. But, over the years, I have been able to accept the Western world with all its good and bad qualities as my own.

Now, with my aspiration-heart, I am praying to God to inundate both the Eastern world and the Western world with His absolute Love, Peace and Delight. And, with my dedication-life, I am trying to inspire the world to cry for a better, purer and higher life.

Sri Aurobindo was flooded with dynamic spirituality. Before Sri Aurobindo there were Vivekananda and Shankaracharya. But long before that was Sri Krishna; he was flooded with infinite dynamic spirituality. At first, Arjuna was unwilling to fight against his dear ones, but Sri Krishna illumined him and encouraged him to fight. The whole Bhagavad Gita is about dynamism. Inside dynamism there is both the yoga of work and the yoga of meditation.

Some spiritual Masters of a very high order did not believe in dynamic spirituality. They did not care for the acceptance of the world. They only wanted to withdraw from the world and meditate. But the acceptance of life and very dynamic spiritual action started with Lord Krishna thousands of years ago.

It could be either. They could have a special love for India because they had previous incarnations there. Again, they could have developed a special love for India in this incarnation because they have read inspiring books about India and heard about Indian spiritual Masters, or because they have studied the Indian forms of yoga and practised meditation in the traditional Indian way. If they have developed a special love for India, and if they want their forthcoming incarnation to be in India, they can pray to God to take a future incarnation in India.

  :PROPERTIES:

The Supreme wanted, He wants and He will always want from India spirituality, spirituality, spirituality. Because we are living in the material world, modern science is needed. Indian villages will remain very, very primitive if they have only a small amount of modern technology, or none at all. Some scientific development is of supreme importance. But the Supreme does not want India to stand side by side with the Western world in scientific development. The Western world has developed very powerful weapons of destruction. The Supreme will never tell India: "You have to make nuclear missiles and hydrogen bombs in order to be as strong as America." No, no! He will say only that on the practical level, on the physical plane, there are a few technological things that India needs for its basic day-to-day necessities. But He will never ask India to accept and embrace the highest Western scientific discoveries, specially not the destructive ones. What He will ask of India is that she maintain her pristine spiritual beauty and fragrance.

If other countries want to go to the moon or to the sun, then let them go. To India the Supreme will say, "Go to the inner moon, go to the inner sun. The inner moon and the inner sun are infinitely more powerful, beautiful and fulfilling." That does not mean that India should disregard the outer world. No, India will live in the world of the outer moon and the outer sun; but it will pray to the Supreme to keep it in touch with its inner moon and inner sun, because what the Supreme wants from each and every Indian is spirituality first, foremost and forever.

I will never dare to say that the Supreme wanted India to play /the/ most significant role in world spirituality right from the dawn of civilisation; that is absurd.

It was chosen to be one of the most spiritually aspiring countries. Right from the beginning the Supreme chose not only India, but five or six other countries as well, to realise, reveal and manifest His Divinity. Those supremely chosen countries are responding to the spiritual light much more than other countries.

  :PROPERTIES:

In India there are four castes: Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra. Mahatma Gandhi found another class also -- the untouchables. He said that untouchables were the favourite children of God.

The Brahmins are supposed to study India's sacred books, such as the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the Vedas and the Upanishads, and meditate on the significance of their messages. If Brahmins study and meditate on the sacred books in this way, they will be able to realise God. That is the sunlit road for them.

The Kshatriyas are warriors. They have the heroic spirit to pierce the veil of ignorance. If somebody is in trouble and needs help, they will help that person. They will not say, "It is your problem; you fight." If somebody comes and attacks their country, they will fight to protect it. But they will not use their weapons to go out and attack other countries. They are not going to drop bombs on other countries. In the modern world, if one country attacks another country, a third country may say, "I clearly see that this country needs my help." The one that has been attacked may say, "I do not need your help. I can solve my own problems." But the third country says, "No, I have to go and help." This is the modern way. But the Kshatriyas will only go to help if someone wants their help. The Kshatriyas represent the dynamic spirit; through vital dynamism they conquer lethargy and ignorance. That is the sunlit road for the Kshatriyas to reach the Highest and go to God.

Then come the Vaishyas. They are merchants and businessmen. Although they deal with money power and material wealth, they are not supposed to be Shylocks. They earn money, and with their money they are supposed to build temples and serve the poor. They are supposed to give money to charity and support the development of their country as well as using their material wealth to help their own family members. Their road is not sunlit, but if they use their material wealth properly -- to build temples, serve the poor and develop their country -- then they also will be able to make spiritual progress.

The fourth class is the Shudras, the servant class. Their occupation is to serve their brothers and sisters by bringing them food or doing physical labour. The earthly, mundane jobs they do.

Some may say the Brahmins are superior to the Kshatriyas, the Kshatriyas are superior to the Vaishyas and the Vaishyas are superior to the Shudras. But that is not true. In a family each member has a different job. If you are studying the Vedas and there is nobody cultivating the ground and bringing you food, then you will die. Each role is needed, and each person serves in his own capacity. If each one does his respective job soulfully and lovingly, then he is walking on the brightest road for himself and making the fastest progress.

No matter which caste an individual has taken birth into, if he combines the activities of all the castes, then his progress will be the fastest. But it may be difficult for someone to combine the duties of all the castes. If someone is seriously studying the Vedas, he cannot go out and work in the fields or start a business or join the army and serve his country. But while he is studying, he can pray to God for his brothers and sisters who are in a position to be dynamic in other capacities. If he has this kind of good will, then he is covering the activities of the other three castes also. If someone does not have the capacity or talent to do the good work of all the others, he can still try to bring their good qualities into himself and help them with his prayers and meditation. In that way he will also expedite his own spiritual journey.

In the past some Indians believed that the poorer they were, the nearer they were to God. They believed that if you are poor on the material plane, then you will be rich in spirituality. But that is absurd. Do you think that Indian street beggars are all wonderful seekers and God-lovers? Far from it! Instead of thinking of God, in most cases they are thinking of how they can get a meal or a piece of clothing. Again, if you wallow in the pleasures of the material life, as the Western world is doing, then from the spiritual point of view you are in serious trouble. If you are constantly thinking only of how you can increase your material wealth, then where is God for you? And if your mind is telling you that once you get ten million dollars, then you will not have to work and you will have plenty of time to meditate, that also is the height of stupidity. Yes, you will have the time to meditate, but you will only be meditating on your greed.

So you do not have to be the world's poorest person in order to realise God. Again, you do not have to be the world's richest person in order to realise God. But you have to be able to meet your basic needs. Otherwise, if you do not have rice and bread, if you do not have the things your body needs to live, then how can you think of God? So it is not wise to want to amass money and, at the same time, it is the height of stupidity to want to give away all your possessions and live in the street. There has to be a balance.

God does not want you to cut off your limbs to show Him how much you love Him. He does not require you to deliberately embrace a life of poverty to prove your love for Him. He wants you only to have an inner cry for Him. That alone is of supreme importance.



* /Question:/ The Western world sees Indian society as chaotic and underdeveloped. Is Western society any better?

Let us say India is chaotic and the West is neurotic. Which one is better? In the East, let us say, everything is disorderly and chaotic. But in the West, everything seems meaningless and senseless. People care only about amassing wealth and enjoying pleasure-life. They think of themselves and others in a destructive way. Western countries are generally not as disorderly as India, but they have other weaknesses and imperfections, and at any moment these weaknesses and imperfections could destroy the whole world.

So both parties are wanting in light. But it would be a mistake for America to say that India's imperfections are worse or of a lower type, or for India to say that America's imperfections are worse. To say that my imperfections are not as dangerous or destructive as yours is the height of stupidity. You and I are both imperfect. Our imperfections are more than enough for us to spend the rest of our lives trying to illumine them. Both of us have to bring down light and pray to God to illumine our lives.

You may say, "Oh, my imperfections are negligible; I can easily overcome them." But the moment you try to conquer them, you will see that it is the most difficult thing. Let us say that you have been telling lies for twenty years. For one hour you will tell the truth; then, out of the blue, falsehood will descend again. Or if someone else is overweight, he will say, "I can easily stop eating." Then for a few days he will try, but soon his determination will disappear. So each of us must take our own imperfections as seriously as possible.

Instead of criticising others, let us try to keep our own body, vital and mind under control. If we can control ourselves, if we can have determination to do the right thing and become the best possible person, then there is hope that others will also have the same determination to improve their lives. It is our own longing for perfection, our own cry for perfection, that is of paramount importance. If I can become perfect, then there will be one less rascal on earth. So if I try and you try and everybody else tries, then real progress will be made on earth. If today I become perfect, tomorrow you become perfect and the day after tomorrow somebody else becomes perfect, then someday everybody will be perfect.

If one is spiritual, that does not mean that one will not suffer. Spiritual people may suffer for various reasons.

Again, even if a particular country is ready to lead, which countries will follow it? There will always be some countries that will never, never follow the lead of any other country in spite of knowing full well inwardly that another country is by far the best and this country has the capacity to change the face and fate of the world. Some countries will not be receptive enough to accept its light or will not have enough light themselves to acknowledge the superiority and abide by the will of that particular country. Again, there will be many countries that will be fully awakened to the light, and will definitely follow the country that has the wisdom and inner light to lead and guide the rest of the world.

India does not have to defend her soul's righteousness. India has come into existence only to abide by God's Decree and God's Command. Some people may say that the sun is not bright enough or that it is losing its power and warmth day by day, but the sun does not have to defend itself. The sun only has to shine on and on. There are countless people who appreciate its power and light. If others do not believe in it, that is their loss, their supreme loss.

Similarly, India does not have to defend her spirituality. If others do not recognise it, or if others blame India's lack of outer progress on her spiritual development, it will be their deplorable mistake. If the West says, "Because of this or that, India is not making outer progress," then India can also say, "Because of this and that, America is not making inner progress." But it does no good for America or India to criticise one another like this. We have to feel that the world is one -- a oneness-home -- and we have to pray for the development, the success and the progress of all the countries, not only our own country. Only then are we doing the right thing.

There is no difference. What Indian spirituality was will forever remain the same. Modern India will always keep the spirituality that was born countless years ago. It is true that human beings have become ultra-modern, so they may not or cannot or do not want to be strict with their spiritual life. There are millions and millions of people not only living abroad but also in India itself who do not care for self-discipline. So in that sense you can say there is not the same degree of self-discipline as there was before. But when we are speaking of real spirituality, there is no difference between ancient spirituality and modern spirituality; spirituality in its pristine beauty will always remain the same whether it is found in the ancient world or in the modern world.

There are many, many unimaginably good qualities that India once had. But now India does not want these divine qualities to come to the fore and manifest themselves; now India does not want to carry those divine qualities of the highest height. Because of that, the soul of India is sad. But again, the soul of India is also looking forward to receiving a new supply of freshness, newness, oneness and fulness from her 50th Anniversary celebrations.

Everything is due to the Grace of the Supreme. Whether the souls that descend are advanced or not advanced, it is His Will that all souls ultimately have to fulfil. It is not that all advanced souls will take birth in India and less advanced souls will take birth in other places -- no, no, no! If you feel that India has a few advanced souls, then it is one hundred percent due to the Grace of the Supreme. You may say that India was more receptive, but if the Supreme wants to give some individual or some country His special Blessings, special Grace and special Preference, He can do so. He can force that country to receive, even if that country is unwilling to receive. It is like a mother forcing her child to eat, even if he does not want to eat. But if the child is hungry most of the time, then it is easier for the mother to feed the child.

It is true to some extent that poverty keeps India's simplicity and purity. But the real purity that is needed to realise God or to become inseparably one with God's Will is something infinitely more than what can come from poverty and simplicity. Just because one is poor, we cannot say that one is also pure. There are many poor people on earth who are unbearably impure. Poverty may help a little because at least the poor are not wallowing in the pleasures of material wealth. But whether material wealth is a blessing or a curse depends on how we utilise it. We can use a knife to cut a fruit and share it with a friend, or we can use a knife to stab someone. Material power and material wealth are like that. If they are used for a divine purpose, they are a blessing. If they are used for undivine purposes, then definitely they are a curse.

Some of them are not even following spirituality. They felt they had had enough. They had reached a certain height and did not want to continue in that direction immediately. It is like somebody who went to graduate school in one field and then changed subjects without getting a Ph.D. in the particular subject in which he started.

On the other hand, even if you live thousands of miles away in America, if you have a very deep feeling for the silence of the Himalayas and if you think of or meditate on the Himalayas, then you get the benefit.

You do not have to go to the Himalayas to feel their consciousness; it is with your aspiration that you can get blessings from the Himalayas. You can get inspiration from the Himalayas by just imagining them or meditating on them or thinking of their peace, height and sublimity. Similarly, you do not have to go to India to feel the consciousness of India. If you just think of India's inner silence, India's inner peace, India's inner vastness, then immediately you get the consciousness of India. And the Himalayas embody those inner qualities to a great extent.

In some cases, both the soul of the new country and the soul of India will bless the child. But the most important blessing comes not from the soul of any country.

* /Question:/ Who were the Aryans? Where did they come from?

Some say they came from abroad. Others say they originated in India but were more cultured and more illumined than the rest of the population. Again, some say the Aryans came before the Dravidians, and others say the Dravidians were in south India long before the Aryans. My intuition says that the Aryans did not come from elsewhere but originated in India. On the strength of their inner urge, they prayed and meditated. They received light from Above and responded to it. They went high and deep at the same time. So, according to my own inner feeling, the Aryan culture came not from an invasion, but from the illumination of some people or some groups within India. As in a family where there are five children, one can be much more spiritual than the others. He or she goes deep within and discovers some inner wealth while the others are still enjoying their ignorance-sleep.

The Aryan sages discovered that there were many cosmic gods who could bless them with the things they longed for. So when they prayed or meditated, they invoked different cosmic gods for different things. This moment they prayed to Agni and the next moment they prayed to Vayu. They definitely knew that there is a Supreme God, the Absolute Transcendental Lord Supreme, who has infinite Light, Power, Peace and Bliss. But, unfortunately, they did not find Him as easy to approach as the lesser deities.

Since one doctor carries all the medicine, I do not know why they chose to go to one doctor for a headache, another for a stomach upset and a third for knee pain. On the earthly level, different doctors specialise in different ailments. But in the spiritual life there is only one ailment -- ignorance -- and for that ailment illumination is the only cure. If we receive illumination from the Highest, from the Source, then we are more convinced than if we get it from someone who may be higher than us but who is infinitely lower than the Highest. So if we can establish a free access to the absolute Highest and receive Light from Him, then our inner conviction becomes much, much stronger.

The realisations of the spiritual Masters of the last few hundred years are higher, richer and deeper than those of the Vedic seers. We shall appreciate and adore the Vedic seers because they are the source of our aspiration and our wisdom. We shall adore them like grandfathers because they had the inclination to study at the inner school. If we do not value the wisdom of our grandfathers and great-grandfathers, then we will be the losers. But we have to know that the wisdom and inner wealth that they achieved is nothing in comparison to the inner wisdom that their grandchildren have acquired. If we say that their realisations were higher than those of later spiritual Masters, then we are just fooling ourselves. In his story "The Ideal of Forgiveness," Sri Aurobindo said that the achievements of the Vedic seers of the hoary past will pale into insignificance when the achievements of more recent spiritual figures are blossomed.

But sometimes, by appreciating our ancestors, we increase our own heart's enthusiasm-thrill. This inner thrill helps us immensely in all walks of life. If we have an inner thrill, we can go the fastest on any project in any field -- whether it is writing poetry or composing songs or running, diving and flying. The inner thrill is of paramount importance if we want to reach our destination.

There are many things that the Vedic seers envisioned, and sometimes their visions were very high. But, unfortunately, they could not properly interpret their visions. They saw something and gave meaning to it, but their meaning was not absolutely accurate because it was not as profound as it could have been. But then the yogis and seers who succeeded them were able to discover, on the strength of their own deeper and higher realisations, the actual significance of the visions that the Vedic seers of the hoary past had. Because their own realisations were much higher, they could give a better, clearer and more illumining interpretation to the experiences of these Vedic seers.

If we try to interpret an experience with our mind's capacity, we will be totally lost. But if we can take the experience with us into the heart, then immediately we get a full view of the experience -- where it came from, why it came and how it can be fully and fruitfully utilised. So if we can use our heart, rather than our mind, when we read about the experiences of the Aryan sages and seers in the Vedas and Upanishads, then we shall be able to discover our own Source.

Scholars approach the Vedas and the experiences of the Vedic seers in their own way, which is drier than the driest. They use their mental geometry. But the geometry and grammar of the Vedas and Upanishads cannot fulfil the heart's cry. Philosophers approach the experiences of the Vedic seers in another way, which is theoretical rather than practical or practicable. But seekers of the highest order and realised Masters use the experiences of the Vedic sages to help them establish something solid and basic in their lives; they make these experiences practical. They deal with the experiences of the Vedic seers in such a beautiful, tangible and illumining way that they actually manifest the beauty and fragrance of these experiences and make them a living reality in their own lives. So the scholastic and philosophical approaches are not beneficial for the sincere seeker. It is only the spiritual, psychic approach that can fulfil the real sincere God-hunger of humanity.

He went to Puri and a few other religious places where he studied the Sanskrit language and Indian scriptures. In Benares he studied Indian languages. In Chittagong there is a temple where they believe the Christ spent a number of years. Three or four other places in Chittagong he was also said to have visited, and his belongings remain there. But whether Jesus Christ came to India or not is of no consequence to the real seeker. For the seeker, Christ's place is not in a country but inside the heart. If you are a seeker, you have to find him not in Bethlehem or India but inside your heart.

The soul of England was compelled to bow to the inner pressure from the soul of India. For many years the soul of India tolerated the English rule. Then the soul of India challenged the soul of England. Spiritual power will always win eventually, and the soul of India has so much spiritual wealth. India's spiritual will-power far exceeds the will-power of England, and this will-power the soul of India exercised.

At first, England responded by inwardly challenging India. Then fear entered England, and finally they adopted a positive approach. They said, let us be kind and generous. Their attitude was like a master towards a slave. When the master feels that the slave will revolt and kill him, he decides that it will be better to give him his freedom. The master can be conquered either with outer power or with inner will. From the strict spiritual point of view, India had the inner will. This inner will was accumulated by her spiritual children of that era -- Swami Vivekananda, Sri Aurobindo and others. Mother India's liberation and the spiritual height of Swami Vivekananda, Sri Aurobindo and others run parallel. They brought forward the power of Mother India's soul, and placed it in a kind of spiritual bank. Sri Aurobindo himself put a very, very large amount there. Then India's political freedom-fighters availed themselves of this power.

Sri Aurobindo was so happy that Mother India gained her independence on his birthday, August 15th. His seventy-fifth birthday was celebrated on that day. Sri Aurobindo issued a statement which began: "August 15th, 1947 is the birthday of free India. It marks for her the end of an old era, the beginning of a new age. But we can also make it, by our life and acts as a free nation, an important date in a new age opening for the whole world, for the political, social, cultural and spiritual future of humanity.

"August 15th is my own birthday and it is naturally gratifying to me that it should have assumed this vast significance. I take this coincidence, not as a fortuitous accident, but as the sanction and seal of the Divine Force that guides my steps on the work with which I began life, the beginning of its full fruition...."

  :PROPERTIES:

  :KEYWORDS:
  :END:


From the highest spiritual point of view, it was the power of the spirit that brought about India's independence. This inner power was expressed by different leaders in different ways. In the beginning, Sri Aurobindo was a revolutionary. He instigated his brother and others to engage in revolutionary activities. Then he entered into the spiritual life -- first, to realise God and, side by side with that goal, he had the goal to conquer the British with inner spiritual force. Netaji used another approach. His strategy was to try to throw the British out of India using military power. He failed in his main aim, which was to raise an army and march to Delhi, but his greatest contribution was to unite Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Christians and Jains in his Indian National Army. No other Indian political leader, military leader or even spiritual leader can claim to have united Indians the way Netaji did.



* Sri Chinmoy, you are a man of peace. Was it difficult at any stage for you to identify with my father because, after all, he was not strictly a man of peace. He was a man of military action.

/(Question by Professor Anita B. Pfaff -- Daughter of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose)/

Not at all, sister! Shall I tell you why? Your father changed his policy. He had every right to do so. Peace may be expressed in two ways: it can be static or it can be dynamic. It is like the ocean. On the very bottom, the ocean is calm and quiet, whereas on the surface it can be very tumultuous and rough. When your father started his political career, he gave up everything. Sacrifice became his very name. He wanted to see power inside the peace of the heart. He felt that when Indians were truly united, their power would come to the fore and the British would be compelled to leave the country in a peaceful manner.

But gradually he came to realise that each of the many different groups comprising India had its own way of expressing itself. Each one had its own leader, its own belief. One group followed Mahatma Gandhi, another group followed your father, a third group followed someone else, and so on. Although Netaji tried his utmost to bring about unity among all the groups, specially in the political sphere, he was forced to realise that this way would not be feasible. Then he decided that if peace could not be achieved through inner unity, it had to be achieved through military action. The British were using their military might to suppress the Indians. Netaji believed that if he attacked them on their own level, it would force the Indians to unite, and the British would not be able to withstand the power of the whole country.

Let me give you a simple analogy. Let us say that a thorn has entered my heel. I may try to use medicine to bring the thorn out. But there is another way. I can use a second thorn to take out the thorn that is inside my heel. Then what will become of the second thorn, the one that was of help to me? I will simply throw it away, along with the first one.

Your father was misunderstood because he went to Germany to seek help from Hitler and various other European leaders. Some of his countrymen said to him, "What are you doing? Germany is worse than Great Britain!" But Netaji's reply was, "I know they are worse, but I am ready to take help from anybody. My immediate enemy is Great Britain. Great Britain has enslaved my Motherland. I have to get rid of my immediate enemy. Then, if I am successful, in the future I can get rid of the one that I have taken help from. If I can use this thorn to remove the one that is already inside my foot, then one day definitely I will be able to get rid of the second thorn."

In the beginning, it was beyond his imagination that he would adopt this way of freeing his country. But when he saw that all other procedures had failed, he knew that there was no other way. It was the last resort. This is the thing that people do not understand.

In the Bhagavad Gita, which is our most sacred book, our Bible, Lord Krishna tried in every way to avert the Battle of Kurukshetra. He begged the Kauravas to settle their differences with the Pandavas without entering into the battlefield. He did not succeed. When Lord Krishna saw that all other means had failed, only then did he ask the Pandavas, the virtuous ones, to fight against the Kauravas, who were hostile forces incarnate. The Pandavas entered into the Battle of Kurukshetra as a last resort. For the establishment of Truth, they had to take up their weapons. The Pandavas were righteous, but there was no other way to bring about peace than to fight. It was for the victory of Truth that Lord Krishna asked them to fight.

Your father knew that India's freedom was his birthright. When he saw that the other way, the way of peaceful settlement, was not making any progress, he decided he had to try a new way. In his thinking, he was far ahead of all the other patriots of his day. Needless to say, I am totally convinced that your father did absolutely the right thing. He was the harbinger, the pathfinder. His vision was much vaster and deeper than that of the other Indian national leaders of the time. In everything he went ahead, and it was only later that others followed him.

Both Mahatma Gandhi and Netaji played their distinctive roles in bringing about India's independence. Your cousin Dr. Sisir Bose, Netaji's beloved nephew, has most aptly summed it up when he said, "The Father of the Indian nation is Mahatma Gandhi; the Father of the Indian revolution is Subhas Bose."

For that we need another Mikhail Gorbachev! I do not see how India can become one again in the near future. As if it was not bad enough to be dominated by England for two hundred years, another hostile attack had to come in the form of our own leaders who agreed to the partition of India. Even afterwards, when Bangladesh wanted to rejoin India, when it would have been the easiest thing for the Indian government to allow Bengalis to be reunited, the government would not allow it. Ordinary people were suffering so much because of the partition, but the Indian government felt that it could not control a united Bengal. A little portion, Bangladesh -- my birthplace -- was eager to rejoin the subcontinent, but alas, the people in power did not want them to.



* /Question:/ What has India gained by the introduction of the English language?

  :PROPERTIES:

England practically destroyed India, true, but England did give a gift to India for which India will remain eternally, eternally, eternally grateful to England and that gift is the English language. The English language is India's matchless treasure. If an Indian in India goes 60 or 80 miles from his home, he may find people who speak his own dialect, but a few words will be different. If he goes 200 miles away, he will not be able to understand anything! Does a Bengali understand even one word of Telegu? Does a Tamil know even one word of Bengali? And even our Bengali language has so many dialects. I come from Chittagong. There are so many words that I use which are not to be found in any Bengali dictionary. Calcutta Bengalis will laugh at our Chittagong dialect! So in that way, the English language has saved us. It has given us a common language to unite us on a national level and, on the international level, it has enabled us to participate in the international community.

Before Your blessingful, august Presence.

A new supply of strength

Resides in us,
Exactly the same way
The Life-Force abides in all,
And accepts and endures
Each and every human being.

You are the Source

Before You we place
Our supplication, devotion
And adoration-surrender.

No iota of fear have we
While offering You
Our wee, puny and paltry gifts,
For we know
You are the Compassion-Lord
Of our motherless, fatherless, helpless life.
You are the Vision-Light
Of the whole universe.
You are our Eternity's only Friend.

Most insignificant.
Notwithstanding, lovingly
You accept our service-flames
To bless us

In fire and water,
In dust and atoms,
Seeing You, Your Meditation-Trance,
Many poets have depicted
Your immortal Beauty.

They are our pioneers.
We are walking along the same road
To reach Your hallowed Feet.
This beautiful morning
We are weaving the garland
Of our heart's message,
Prayerful and soulful:

"Victory, victory, victory
To Sri Aurobindo,
The Guru Supreme of the Universe!"
Sleeplessly and breathlessly
Repeating this incantation,
We shall become
Eternity's sweetness-purity-breath.

You have donned
An earthly cloak.
We place at Your Feet
Our surrender unconditional
For Your unhorizoned Manifestation
Here on earth.
