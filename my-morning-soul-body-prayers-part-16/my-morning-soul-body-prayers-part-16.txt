Sri Chinmoy offered this final prayerful message as he concluded his weightlifting endeavours since resuming weightlifting on 29 September 1998. During this period of two years and fifteen days, he has offered 1,307 prayers.

My physical weightlifting-journey ends,

But my spiritual God-crying-journey

Shall never end.
