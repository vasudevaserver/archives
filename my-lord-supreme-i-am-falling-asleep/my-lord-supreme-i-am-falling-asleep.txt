My Lord Supreme,
How can my mind, my heart
And my life be truly happy'?
My child,
Your mind can be truly happy
Only by renouncing
Its possession-greed,
Your heart, by multiplying
Its God-hunger
And your life, by enjoying
Its God-surrender-feast.

Inside my Golden Boat
And sail together
To the Shores

My Lord Supreme,
What do You do
When I demand something from You
And expect something from You
And really need something from You?
My child,
When you demand, I immediately fall asleep
And start snoring.
When you expect, I quickly wake up
And start singing.
When you need, I sprint toward you
Like your Sudhahota Carl Lewis,
The world's fastest sprinter,
And smilingly reach you
And affectionately give you what you need.

My Lord Supreme,
I feel so sorry for You.
I really do.
My child,
Why do you feel sorry for Me?
I am so clever that I can easily convince You
That I love You, but You find it so difficult
To convince me that You love me,
Therefore, I feel sorry for You.
My child,
I am so grateful to you that you have such
Genuine sympathy for Me.
Where can I find
Another sympathetic heart like yours?

#+BEGIN_VERSE

My Lord Supreme,
When I devotedly pray
and soulfully meditate,
I can clearly see that my life is
an open book to You.
But alas, no matter how hard I try
to know about
Your earthly life and Heavenly life,
I sadly fail.
Therefore I am begging You to be kind to me
And share some of Your secrets.
My child,
I shall comply with your request
But I do not know whether My secrets
Will make you happy or unhappy.
Anyway, I leave it up to you.
My secret number one:
Each time your desiring mind
Defeats your aspiring heart,
I cry and cry.
My secret number two:
When you dine with your mind-doubts
And starve your heart-faith,
I cry and cry.
My secret number three:
Each time you do not allow your heart
To fulfil its Heaven-climbing promises,
I cry and cry.
My secret number four:
Each time you do not allow your soul to fulfil
Its Heaven-manifesting promises on earth,
I cry and cry.
My secret number five:
When your life-boat plies
Between your depression-vital-shore
And your frustration-mind-shore,
I cry and cry.
My secret number six:
When you become the most intimate friend
Of your body's idleness
and your mind's unwillingness,
I cry and cry.
My Lord Supreme,
I don't know why I suddenly feel so tired
and sleepy.
It seems that You have literally
endless secrets.
Yes, my child. I do.
Then,
My Lord, some other day
I shall definitely hear more of Your secrets.
My child, My child, wait, wait.
Only one more secret I wish to share
with you
Before you fall asleep.
This time, I am blessing you
with My topmost secret:
You are My Today's Self-Transcendence-Dream
And My Tomorrow's Self-Perfection-Satisfaction-Reality.
My Lord Supreme,
I am fast asleep.
I cannot hear You anymore.
My child, I am still fully awake.
I shall do everything for you.
You enjoy your sweet sleep.
