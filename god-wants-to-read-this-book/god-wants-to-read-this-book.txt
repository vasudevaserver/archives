#+BEGIN_VERSE

Who is it who is reading this book?
Is it these hands which turn the pages?
Is it these eyes that follow the printed words?
Is it this mind that tries to understand their meaning?
Is it even this heart which feels joy and inspiration?
No, the one who is really reading this book is God.
