/Yogi:/ When you are in front of me, speak first and then think, to see if you have said the right thing. When you are physically away from me, think of me soulfully first and then speak to me silently.

/Yogi:/ Yes. To cover the sea, water is needed. To fill the heart, love is needed. To cover the mind, truth is needed. To fulfil the soul, aspiration-flames are needed.

/Yogi:/ Outer information, no. It is not necessary, either. Inner information, yes. This inner information is called the soul's glorious preparation. The outer school does not know what aspiration is. The inner school does not know what information is. Information is possessed and cherished by the mind. Aspiration is offered by God and utilised by man.

/Yogi:/ Feel that you are not indispensable either on earth or in heaven. Also try to realise that humility is something that man cleverly shows and God fully is. Finally, the very pursuit of your inner glory will make you humble.

/Yogi:/ You complain because you are not in love with aspiration. You explain because you are not in love with realisation. Aspiration is far above complaint. Realisation is far above explanation.

  :PROPERTIES:

/Yogi:/ A liberated soul usually does not care for God-manifestation on earth. He feels that once he is liberated, his role in the cosmic drama is ended. A realised soul cries for God-manifestation. He feels that once he is realised, his role in the cosmic drama has properly begun. A liberated soul is freed from the meshes of ignorance, and at the same time is extremely careful of wild ignorance. A realised soul has discovered his own inner divinity which is flooded with God's all-seeing vision and all- fulfilling reality. A liberated soul usually uses God according to his own capacity. A realised soul uses God only when asked by God Himself. The human and the unreal in us cease in liberation. The divine and the real in us begin in realisation.

/Yogi:/ What kind of injustice are you hurling at me? Do you want me always to draw the breath of my life in you brooding vice! Believe me, I have already run out of advice What now I am giving you and others is not advice, but my self-imposed futile concern.

  :END:


/Yogi:/ Perhaps you do not know the real reason. You know, long, long ago, long before my full realisation, there was a time when God listened to me more than I listened to him, so now God is paying me back through my disciples. On achieving my highest realisation, I have really become a good boy. I always listen to Him in my life of aspiration, realisation, revelation and manifestation.



* 60. My name is Thomas. Forgive me, doubt and I are inseparable. I am sure I shall ask God for proof even when He stands right in front of me.

/Yogi:/ That is why poor God is moving heaven and earth in search of His identification card. It seems to me that He has misplaced it. No, I am wrong. Excuse me. I am now positive that God has compassionately thrown His identification card deep inside your ignorance-sea. Unfortunately, the dragon-doubt in your ignorance-sea has devoured it completely. Poor God. Since you are responsible for God losing His identification card, it will be nice, kind and generous of you not to embarrass God by asking Him for it. Next time when God comes and stands in front of you, immediately tell Him, at least for my sake, that you have revoked you charge and that you have accepted Him as your Lord Supreme, as your very own.

  :END:


An unaspiring man desires beauty without. A seeker of Peace desires beauty within. A lover of God desires both beauty within and beauty without.

The outer beauty that a lover of God desires is totally different from the beauty that an unaspiring man cries for. An unaspiring man is both tempted and tempting. When he is tempted, he wants the outer world of beauty to cherish him. When he is tempting, he wants to bind the outer world of beauty. His acts of tempting others and of being tempted by others eventually lead him into frustration. Lo, inside his frustration there are two animals, a tiger and a cat. The cat is being devoured by the tiger. Soon he comes to realise that the tiger is none other than his all-devouring ego, and that the cat is none other than his ever-crying and begging desire.

A God-lover's outer beauty: he wants his outer beauty to inspire the length and breadth of the world. His beauty is the beauty of a fragrant rose. His beauty is the affection of an affectionate mother. His beauty is the beauty of a fruitful tree.

A fragrant rose makes our outer body fragrant. An affectionate mother offers to our outer life a flood of affection. A fruitful tree reminds us of our inner tree which bears joy, countless joys.

A God-lover's inner beauty: his inner beauty is the flowering of his consciousness. His inner beauty is the height of his aspiration. His inner beauty is the light of his realisation.

The outer beauty is the necessity of humanity. The inner beauty is the light of his realisation.

An aspirant is really beautiful when he comes to learn that he is all heart. An aspirant is divinely beautiful when he feels that he is all soul. An aspirant is supremely beautiful when he discovers that he has in abundant measure what God eternally is.

When we live in the emotional vital, our beauty is an outer gift. When we live in the aspiring heart, our beauty is an inner gift. The outer gift feels the outer world as a world of strangers. The inner gift feels the inner world as a world of illumining and illumined oneness.



* Beauty II

  :GENRE: discourse

  :END:


Beauty without light is a flower without fragrance. Beauty with light is a human being without ignorance.

The beauty of life is our purity's spontaneity. The beauty of truth is our sincerity's necessity. The beauty of God-realisation is our aspiration's divinity.

We look beautiful within when our passions die. We look more beautiful within when our inner flame mounts. We look most beautiful within when our sun of realisation bursts.

The power of beauty is an aspirant's manifested motherhood. The peace of beauty is an aspirant's fulfilled fatherhood. The bliss of beauty is an aspirant's transformed and divinised manhood.

When I am physically beautiful, God smiles. God smiles at me because I am using His own dress. When I am spiritually beautiful, God plays. God plays with me because He has got me as His own playmate.

He who does not become, spiritually, the pages of cosmic beauty, will one day ruthlessly be compelled to read the book of fate, by Ignorance. Not even God the Compassionate will hide the book of fate from him

If we start with the soul's beauty, we can end in the Supreme's transcendental Reality. Let us start.

Obscurity says to Beauty: "Beauty, why are you so beautiful?"

Beauty answers, "Obscurity, better ask me how I am so beautiful and not why. I am beautiful because my heart's soulful cry always touches the feet of God."

Purity speaks to Beauty: "Beauty, I wish to stay with you for some time."

Beauty answers, "Purity, certainly you may. I would love to have you. But don't forget to bring your identification."

"What is my identification? " asks Purity.

"Don't you know what your identification is? Your identification is your life-long spontaneity."

Austerity speaks to Beauty: "Beauty, you are a fool. You never aspire. I am really sorry to tell you that you are God's only failure."

"Austerity, granted, I am God's failure. But certainly you are no better than I am. Remember, God is all Love. Remember, God is all recreation."

Calamity says to Beauty: "Beauty, I loved you. Look at my deplorable consciousness. Look at time which has deserted me. Look at my fallen life!"

"Calamity, I can solve all your problems, once and for all. Give me your deplorable consciousness. From now on, it will live with my inner life. Give me the time that has deserted you. From now on, it will live with my inner breath. Give me your fallen life. From now on, it will live with my inner Goal."

Dignity speaks to Beauty: "Beauty, I understand perfectly why others bow down to you, but I do not know what makes me bow to you."

"Dignity, your heart's necessity tells you that I have the power to increase the capacity of your nobility's light."

Hostility says: "Beauty, my name is Hostility. I want to destroy you. I want to banish you from God's world. I want to destroy your beauty, both inner and outer, here and now."

Beauty says, "Hostility, you can never destroy me because inside me God the Necessity is immortalising me. Outside me, God the Omnipotent Reality is protecting me, cherishing me and fulfilling me."

Divinity whispers: "Can you tell me, Beauty, why I need you throughout Eternity?"

"Mother, you need me because within me you see your own everlasting divine sovereignty."

Aspiration you want? Knock at the door of Silence. Silence you want? Knock at the door of Surrender. You will get what you want and something more: Liberation.

I repeat God's name, not because I feel that by repeating God's name I shall be able to unseal God's ears, but because I see Him in different forms of inner beauty while each time I repeat His name.

Love of God is the beginning of human wisdom. Surrender to God's Will is the flowering of divine wisdom.

God shoots the arrows of concern from the bow of compassion. Man shoots the arrows of ingratitude from the bow of ignorance.

Self-control is the root of higher wisdom.

Self-realisation is the tree of inner wisdom.

Unfortunately the eye of fear has a free access to God's entire creation. Fortunately the heart of courage also has a free access to God's entire creation.

If you can make your heart the cow of love, your body the dog of devotion, and your mind the deer of surrender, your liberation is absolutely certain.

Human life is always given strength to fly the kite of hope.

Anger is ink spilt and thrown over one's graceful heart of sweetness.

The tree of life can never be separated from the tree of love. The tree of love can never be separated from the tree of realisation. The tree of realisation can never be separated from the tree of transcendental perfection.
