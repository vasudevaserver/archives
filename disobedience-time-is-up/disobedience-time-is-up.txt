God's rival you are.

Disobedience,
Can you not try to be
God's worthy rival
By offering Him your
Ignorance-mountain
And
Ignorance-ocean?
Can you not try to become
His Eternity's choicest instrument,
Him to love,
Him to fulfil in His own Way?
Do not forget
That you are of God.
Do not forget
That you are for God
ONLY.
