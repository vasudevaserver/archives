#+BEGIN_VERSE

Supreme, Supreme, Supreme, Supreme!
    I bow to Thee, I bow.
    My life Thy golden plough;
My journey's Goal Thy soulful Dream.
Supreme, Supreme, Supreme, Supreme!
    I bow to Thee, I bow.

Supreme, I am Thy glowing Grace.
    My world, Thy Feet of Light;
    My breath, Thy Vision's kite.
Thou art one Truth, one Life, one Face.
Supreme, Supreme, Supreme, Supreme!
    I bow to Thee, I bow.

-- Sri Chinmoy \\
