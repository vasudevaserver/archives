IF I LISTEN

My Lord asks me
Whom to listen to?

"If I listen to the demands of your body,
You will grow into a blind beggar.

You will grow into a wild elephant.

"If I listen to the demands of your mind,
You will grow into unparalleled insanity.

"If I listen to the demands of your heart,
You will grow into the ignorance-King."
