DON'T BELIEVE

My foolish heart,
Who told you
That I do not love you?
Don't believe insecurity.
I tell you,
Insecurity is a graceless liar.
My foolish mind,
Who told you
That I do not need you?
Don't believe doubt.
I tell you,
Doubt is a hopeless liar.
My foolish vital,
Who told you
That I hate you?
Don't believe impurity.
I tell you,
Impurity is a shameless liar.
My foolish body,
Who told you
That I force you?
Don't believe lethargy.
I tell you,
Lethargy is a useless liar.

The frontiers of my soul,
My cry found its perfect home
In God's Smile
And
God's Smile found its perfect Home
In my cry.
