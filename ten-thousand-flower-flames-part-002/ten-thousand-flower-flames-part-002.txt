If you think of yourself alone,
A flower-future
Will not be guaranteed.

If you think of the world more
Than you think of yourself,
A flower-future may be guaranteed.

If you think of God most of the time,
There is a good possibility
That a flower-future will be guaranteed.

But if you think of God and only of God
All the time,
Then a flower-future,
Without fail,
Will be guaranteed.
