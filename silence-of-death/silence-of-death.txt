#+BEGIN_VERSE

Death, may I come in?
"No, definitely not!
You are a shameless liar;
You are a worthless coward,
An impossible creature!

"Hundreds of times
You have begged me
To allow you
To enter into my lifeless Hall,
And I have given you
My immediate permission.
Yet you have invited fear
To capture your heart.

"No more opportunity
Shall be given to you.
With you I shall not share
My nectar-pleasure
And my silence-treasure,
    Never!"

#+BEGIN_VERSE

Death, I do not deny
That I have badly disappointed you.
I have been delaying and delaying my arrival.
But you can easily forgive me
Because my mother,
My father, my brother,
My sister and many
Bosom friends of mine
Have committed suicide.
They came to you;
They entered into your Hall
Long before they were due.
I am sure their early arrival
Can stand against my late arrival.

"You fool, they came in
Before I had invited them.
They were unpardonable intruders.
Never do I forgive such intruders,
Nor does God forgive these life-takers.
I have thrown
The members of your family
And your friends
Into the lowest hell,
Far below your imagination's flight.
Ceaseless torture
Has embraced them.

"I give you my first and last
Piece of advice:
Never take your life away,
      Never!

"Although in your case the time has
  already expired,
And in spite of my immediate need
And demand for your presence,
I am ready to wait for you
      Indefinitely!"

#+BEGIN_VERSE

Death, where are my
Divine brothers,
Sri Krishna and the Christ?
Do you know anything
About them?
Did they enjoy your company?
Did you enjoy their company?

"I hate your divine brothers.
They did not say a word
In my favour
   On earth.
They spoke only of Eternal Life,
My eternal enemy.
But my big heart forgave them;
I immediately showed them
The way to the highest Heaven.
I must say that
Gratitude did not altogether
Desert your divine brothers.
The pride of the East
And the pride of the West
Both garlanded me
Before they left me
For their Father.
Needless to say,
Their Father and my Father
Are eternally one
And supremely inseparable."

Death, why do you live?

Your human life needs divine rest,

After you have fought
In the battlefield of life."

The moment
Bondage and ignorance
Forget your life
And the life of Earth."

Death, how often do you speak to God?

Can you tell me
What both of you talk about?

       And
Our disappointments.
I tell God about my achievements

And His disappointments on earth."

Thank you, Death.

Death, do you have a God like me?
"Yes, I do."
Perhaps we have the same God.
"Yes, we have the same God.
But unlike me
You have two Gods."

No, never!
I have only one God,
And I pray to only one God.

"You liar!
When wild frustration
Embraces you
And untold disgrace
Dances around you,
Whom do you pray to?
To me, my child, to me.
You pray to me:
'O Death, O bountiful Death,
Do come and embrace me.
I need your immediate presence.'
You must know that
Whoever you pray to
Is your God,
Your real God.
Therefore at times
I become your God,
Your only God."

O Death, my stupid curiosity
Deeply admires your Wisdom-Reality.

Death, how often do you speak to Satan?
"I never speak to Satan.
I hate him!
I hate his brutality;
I hate his ignorance-existence-reality.
He is just impossible!"
Why, Death, why?

"You know why.
I love both Heaven and earth.
I love Heaven's flower of beauty.
I love earth's fruit of duty.

"Rascal Satan is always eager
To destroy the flower of God's own Heaven
And the fruit of God's own earth.
One day I shall conquer Satan.
I shall devour Satan.
And then I and my Dream-boat shall enjoy 
God the Beauty,
And I and my Reality-shore
Shall enjoy God the Duty,
Unreservedly and eternally."

Death, please illumine me.
Some people are killed
While defending their own country
When they come to you,
What do you do with them?

"When they come to me,
I bless them and bless them.
I embrace them and embrace them
Until they are tired of my embrace."

And what about those
Who are killed
While attacking another country
And killing its people?
My question is,
What do you do with those aggressors?

"Aggressors? I hate them,
I literally hate them!
I hate them to the same extent
That I hate Satan.
And when they come to me,
I turn them all
Into a huge football
And kick them and kick them
With all the strength of my Thunder-Feet,
Until I am completely exhausted!"

UNFORTUNATE DEATHS

Death,
I know
You vehemently detest suicide-death.
What about the unintentional, unavoidable tragedies:
       Fire-death
       Water-death
       Famine-death
       Car-death
       Aeroplane-death
       And other
       Unfortunate deaths?

"I tell you,
It is mischievous Satan
Who is responsible for all
Sad happenings on earth.
He creates such problems for me!
At times I find it extremely difficult
To house those unfortunate human beings properly,
To my real satisfaction.
I hate Satan
At each hush-gap,
And I really mean it."

Death, here on earth we have telephones.
Do you have telephones in your country?
"Yes, we do."

I am so delighted to hear that.
Now, do you make long-distance calls
As we do from America to Russia?
"Yes, we do.
At every moment
My assistants make thousands
Of long-distance calls
On my behalf."

Thousands of calls?
Good gracious!
To whom do they make so many
Long-distance calls?
"They speak to Heaven and hell on the phone.
At every moment,
Thousands of human souls
We have to dispatch
Either to Heaven or to hell.
We inform Heaven and hell first
Before we send them new members.
We throw those members down,
Who are meant for hell,
And we push those members up,
Who are meant for Heaven."

Death, I am extremely curious to know
Something from you.
"Just ask me,
And my answer will be immediate."

Death, when a desiring man dies,
What do you do with him?
When an aspiring man dies,
What do you do with him?
When a realised man
Leaves the body,
What do you do with him?

"When a desiring man dies,
I immediately give him
The book of frustration to read.
When an aspiring man dies,
I immediately give him
The book of determination to read.
When a realised man 
Leaves the body,
I immediately give him
The Kite of Liberation to fly."

You will see me playing
  With God and His Silence-Soul."

Comfort and immortalise
The tears of the divine soul."

When you despair.

Because the mother in life
Hates your despair.

         When
Is truth afraid of you?
When you give up.

Because the father in truth
Wants you to try
  Time and again.
    Never give up.
      Never!

#+BEGIN_VERSE

Death, when a spiritual Master visits you
On his way to Heaven,
Do you give him a special reception?

"Yes, I do.
But I am so lucky
That God has turned only very few human beings
Into spiritual Masters
Since the very birth of His creation.
Only on very rare occasions
Do I have to welcome a spiritual Master."

O Death, my poor ignorant friend,
Those days are buried in oblivion!
Nowadays thousands of spiritual Masters
Are offering their loftiest Height,
Purest Light
And
Deepest Delight
To their younger brothers and sisters in spirit.
To your wide surprise,
There are some spiritual Masters
Who have the capacity --
Unlike Krishna, the Buddha
And the Christ --
To grant Illumination,
Liberation and Salvation
In the twinkling of an eye.

Again, there are some
Who are simply unique.
Do you know what they do?
They initiate
Over ten thousand people
At a time!
And their initiation has
The thaumaturgic power
To offer their disciples
Illumination, Liberation and Salvation
All at once!

"Is it so?
I must immediately go to Heaven
And inform my comrades Krishna, Buddha and Christ
About the incredible
And unprecedented capacities
Of these spiritual Masters.
I shall tell Krishna, Buddha and Christ
That if they really want to be
Worthy of their successors,
Then they must
Immediately come down
And be their most humble disciples.
I assure you, my divine friends
Are extremely sincere seekers.
They will immediately
Come down
And kiss the very dust
Of the feet of these Masters
Who are granting
Instant Illumination, Liberation and Salvation
Like the earth's instant coffee.
I am so grateful to you
For offering me
This creation-illumining news."

Death, I am so happy that at last
My most dedicated service
Has been of some use to you.
