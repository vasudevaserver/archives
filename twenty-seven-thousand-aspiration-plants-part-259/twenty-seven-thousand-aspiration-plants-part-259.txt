I am ready to go with God
Wherever He goes,
Even to the lower than the lowest hell.

To thank God
For all the good things
That He has done for you,
God will not mind.
It is your soul
That will severely reprimand you.

Has fully surrendered
To my heart-garden.

Give up everything
For the sake of God.
Wisdom of the moderns:
Since God has everything
At His disposal,
Let me have a few minor things
From Him.

Our parents should help us learn
That our mind can be trained
Only by God's Compassion-Eye.

To want to know what is destined
Out of curiosity
Is nothing short of utter stupidity.
But to want to know what is destined
In order to work for
The radical transformation
Of an individual or the whole world
Is quite advisable.

We are doomed to disappointment
When we see someone
Has equalled us,
But in God's case,
He gets Infinity's Joy
And Immortality's Delight
When we just make an attempt
To equal Him.

And teaches my mind, heart and life
The song of Eternity and Infinity.
