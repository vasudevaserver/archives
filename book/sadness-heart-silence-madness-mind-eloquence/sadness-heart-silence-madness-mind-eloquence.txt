/Supreme!/

My solemn promise:
I shall never stand
In Your
Unworthy Presence
With my
Sacred palms together
In supplication.

You will
Never be able
To break
A single smile
Over my
Beautiful face.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

/Supreme!/

I am eagerly waiting
For someone
To replace You,
So that
I can have someone
To swim with me
While I swim
In the sea of tears,
Frustrations
And failures.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

/Supreme!/

You want me
To sacrifice
My life to You.
Never!
You do not value
My life,
To say the least.
Therefore,
I am buying a goat
For sacrifice
To satisfy You,
For I feel
The goat-sacrifice
Will be valued By You.

/Supreme!/

How I wish
It would be
A long-forgotten story
That I have touched Your Feet,
Desired and cried
For anything.

#+END_VERSE

  :PROPERTIES:
  :GENRE:

#+BEGIN_VERSE

/Supreme!/

I call You
My own:
A mistake
That defies
Correction And
Redemption.

True.
My desires
Were great
In number.
But now
My frustrations
Are a million
Times more.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

/Supreme!/

I do not know how
You justify
Your Name:
"Eternity's
Compassion-Eye
And
Immortality's
Forgiveness-Heart."

#+END_VERSE



* 9.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :GENRE:
  :cite-key: HSME:9

#+BEGIN_VERSE

/Supreme!/

To me
The word 'compassion'
Is not applicable
To You.
I have
Luckily ended
My cherished,
Faulty dreams.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :GENRE:

Destruction I see
Within, without,
All around.
You are untroubled,
Unconcerned
And what not.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

/Supreme!/

When necessity demands,
Earthly parents
Warn their children.
I took You
As my only
Parents.
You deliberately
Did not warn me.
It seems
Your dictionary
Does not house
The word 'warning'.
Look at my fate:
Abysmal abyss-sorrows
Have befriended me.

#+END_VERSE



* 12.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :GENRE:
  :cite-key: HSME:12

#+BEGIN_VERSE

/Supreme!/

To worship You
Is to be
Intimately familiar
With the sorrows
And pangs
Of my life-tree
With all its branches,
Flowers, leaves
And fruits.

#+END_VERSE



* 13.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :GENRE:
  :cite-key: HSME:13

#+BEGIN_VERSE

/Supreme!/

Are You blind?
It seems You see
Only when
I am frustrated
And utterly lost
And I thrust
My anger-finger
In Your
Two uncomely Eyes.

#+END_VERSE



* 14.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :GENRE:

#+BEGIN_VERSE

/Supreme!/

My sole desire
Was to become
The golden dust
Of Your Lotus'Feet.
I am so happy
That it is not too late
To withdraw
My desire totally.

#+END_VERSE

The less
I think of You,
The more I am free
From the
World-disease
Which You
Undoubtedly
And solely are.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

/Supreme!/

In those days,
The moment I touched
Your Feet,
Fears and doubts
Devoured me.
You may not believe --
Fears, doubts, anxieties,
Worries, frustrations,
Unbelief and disbelief
Devoured me
And my life.
Alas, a deplorable,
Despicable experience!
In vain, how hard I try
To delete it
From the tablet
Of my heart.

#+END_VERSE

#+BEGIN_VERSE

/Supreme!/

Hard-hearted
You are.
Stony,
In every sense
Of the term,
You are.
From You,
Nothing shall I get,
Nothing do I desire.
I am self-contained,
Self-sufficient.
Believe it or not,
My self-perfection-life
Plus all-satisfaction-life
Is blossoming
Faster than the fastest.

Of my will.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

/Supreme!/

I shall not give way
To sleep.
My mind-tempest,
My heart-tornado
From now on
I shall
Sleeplessly treasure.
For they are real,
Unlike all Your
Hollow Promises.

#+END_VERSE

#+BEGIN_VERSE

/Supreme!/

If anybody asks me
How to pray to You,
I shall tell him
Immediately,
"Do not walk along
That way.
Be not a fool.
Do not invite
The sea of sorrows."
And I mean it!

#+END_VERSE

#+BEGIN_VERSE

/Supreme!/

If anybody asks me
How to meditate
On You,
I shall tell him
Immediately
To meditate
On frustration
Instead.
It will definitely give
A satisfying result.

#+END_VERSE

  :PROPERTIES:
  :GENRE:

I gave up everything
To please You
In Your own Way --
Even the exquisite
Beauty
Of my heart
And the incomparable
Fragrance
Of my soul.

/Supreme!/

I am so glad
That You
Have defeated me
In forgetting me.
Had it been
The reverse,
The whole world
Would have
Looked down
On poor me.

#+END_VERSE

  :PROPERTIES:
  :GENRE:

/Supreme!/

You always
Talk about
Progress, progress.
Progress.
How is it
That You have
Not even once
Said one nice word
Of appreciation
To me
About my
Most astonishing
Rainbow-series
Of progress?

/Supreme!/

Knowing fully well
That You would not
Wake deliberately,
I called and called.
Now I do not mind
Even if You enjoy Your Eternity's
Tranquillity-flooded
Sleep.

#+END_VERSE



* 26.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :GENRE:

#+BEGIN_VERSE

/Supreme!/

I had faith in You
For longer than
The longest time.
I am neither
Begging You
Nor forcing You
To change
The game.
But, I assure You,
If You ever change
The game.
You will not be
Disappointed.

#+END_VERSE

Positions and possessions
I gave You.
I do not have them.
I do not need them either.
My new life
Is my new possession.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :GENRE:

#+BEGIN_VERSE

/Supreme!/

I do not want
My case
To be heard anymore.
I am now mightily free
From my supreme
Fascination-illusion-delusion-dilemmas.
I am now in a world
Of a newly acquired life.
I alone
Am my Eternity's all.

/Supreme!/

Finally,
I am my
Volcano-anger-eruption.
I like it.
I love it.
I treasure it.
I am, at once,
The dreamer
And owner
Of a billion or trillion
Rainbow-dreams.

There was a time
When Your Name
Was my only hope.
Now, my only hope
Is that I can remain
A perfect stranger
To You
Throughout Eternity.

I used to cry.
Weep and sob
At Your Feet.
But those
Malignant diseases
Will never be able
To attack me
Anymore.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :GENRE:

You may say
What I am saying
Is absolutely wrong.
You just tell me
If anything is right
In Your creation.

I have emptied
The tear-oceans
Of my heart.
I do not mind at all
If You do not
Come out of
Your dear, sweet
And self-amorous
Comatose sleep.

#+END_VERSE



* 34.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :GENRE:

#+BEGIN_VERSE

/Supreme!/

You want
Your creation
To please You.
I do not know
How You imagine
Your desire
To be fulfilled
As long as You keep
Your creation
Not only
Unconsciously,
But consciously
Weak, helpless
And hopeless.

#+END_VERSE



* 35.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :GENRE:

To repeat
Your Name
Is to welcome
Untold misfortunes.
This is my
Infallible conviction.

They say
That there are
Countless
Undivine children,
But no
Undivine parents.
Alas, how I wish
It could be true
In Your case.

#+END_VERSE

If You continue
To behave like this,
Then for God's sake,
Do not take
Upon Yourself
The name of the
Compassion-flooded
World-Pilot.

#+END_VERSE



* 38.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :GENRE:

One's self-doubts.

The whole world
Understands me,
My poor heart.
Either You do not know
How to understand me
Or You purposely
Do not care.

Their fulfilment
Elsewhere.

I fed You
With my heart's
Nectar-devotion.
I want the world
To continue
To have faith in You.
Therefore,
I am not telling
The world
What You are
Feeding me with.

Both of us knew
Something special:

How to pray.
You knew
How to spurn.

Even know
The meaning
Of protection.

I clasped Your Feet
Most devotedly.
Alas, it was
My delusion-mind
That compelled me
To do so.

Happiness I sought
At Your Feet.
But what have I found
And become?
A tear-stained face.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

/Supreme!/

Openly,
You tell the doctors
To heal the patient.
Secretly,
You tell death
To kill the patient.
Since the beginning
Of Your creation,
You have been
Playing this game.

I now have become
My greatest victory's
Tallest banner.

Do You have
The capacity
To forgive me?
I do not think
You have.

#+END_VERSE

Do You want me
To forgive You?
For God's sake,
I do not need
And I do not want
To have
That capacity.

It does not matter
Whether You came
To me
Or I came
To You.
We are now
The North Pole
And the South Pole.
This is what
Definitely matters.
