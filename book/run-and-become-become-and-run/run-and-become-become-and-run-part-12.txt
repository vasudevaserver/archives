The other day while I was running in Flushing Meadow Park, a gentleman came up to me and inquired whether our marathon would be held in Flushing Meadow.

I said, "Yes."

Then he said, "In October?"

I said, "On the third of October."

He was very happy. So there are people like me who like to run on a flat course. We have problems going up. Of course, in the inner world if you have problems going up, then you are lost.

If you look at Cahit Yeter after he has run a marathon, he looks as if he has just warmed up. Yes, some other runners defeated him in our Plainsboro marathon, but nobody looked as fresh as he did. Everybody else was out of breath, dying. Because of his ultra-marathoning, 26 miles was nothing for him. But then, if one says to him, "You are an ultra-marathoner," he will say, "Oh, I am not an ultra-marathoner. So and so is a real ultra-marathoner."

Recently I have started practising walking. I sincerely want to become a champion in walking.

I said, "Yes."

He said, "I was worrying because the car was following you." He thought they were going to kidnap me.

When he saw me, he started shouting, "Sri Chinmoy, Sri Chinmoy!" Can you imagine? Even in the dark, people recognise me. Now so many people know us when we run.

Later in the day he came into Annam Brahma and spoke to Dhanu. He said to him, "It was still quite dark. What was Sri Chinmoy doing out there so early?"

At one point in today's run, there was an old man standing by the side of the street with his dog. I was running quite fast, but perhaps I had a tortured look on my face because of my injury. Anyway, when he saw me he said, "You don't look like a runner!"

I said, "You are right. I am not a runner."

God was speaking through that man. The man should have told me, "You should give up running and be a non-runner like me."

Today as I was running back to my starting point on 150th Street, for a mile another runner was bothering me. As soon as she saw me approaching, she began running faster, always staying just a little ahead of me. At first I thought it was X, but then I saw that she had black hair, whereas X's hair is golden.

Every time I came near her, she would go faster, so I couldn't pass her. Then I stopped running for a while and said, "I don't want to see her face." Finally she made a left turn onto a side street.

During a recent run I saw a middle-aged lady running towards me. I was running on the street and she was running on the sidewalk. In order to draw my attention, she left the sidewalk and started running on the street. Then she smiled, raised her hand and said, "Hi!" When men greet me, I say "Hi!" back, but when women greet me, I only smile.

After she passed by me, I turned around and saw that she was again running on the sidewalk. It seems that she went into the street only because there were some parked cars in between us, and she thought that perhaps she would not see me if she remained on the sidewalk.

About three or four days ago I was walking and running on 150th Street. When I was only three hundred metres away from my starting point, a bus stopped and an elderly lady with two shopping bags got off. The shopping bags were full of groceries. With greatest difficulty she lifted up one bag and walked towards her house on a side street.

I looked at her and said, "May I help you?"

She said to me very abruptly, "Of course not!" She spoke so sharply that she practically took my soul out of my body. Then she looked at me again and said, "You are such a great man! Are you not Sri Chinmoy?"

So I gave her a smile and I picked up the other bag and walked with her. When we got to her house, I put the bag on her steps. Again she looked at me in utter amazement.

The following afternoon Dhanu, Databir and quite a few visitors were watching me walk along Main Street. There we have a very accurate course marked off every hundred metres. All the marks on my courses are now accurate because Nirvik has done them. He has done a most careful and accurate job, measuring everything while walking with the wheel.

Since I didn't know where some of the new marks were, Databir went ahead of me to show me. At one point an old, very fat black lady -- twice my size, but very short -- saw us as we were crossing the street. She had two shopping bags, one in each hand. I think that Databir may have said something to her -- God knows. But as I came closer, she was so kind. When I was two metres away, she took the bag from her left hand, put it in her right hand and gave me the right of way. I said, "Thank you so much."

Then she looked into my eyes and said, "Amazingly beautiful!"

Again I thanked her. Then she walked away.

In our 24-hour race this weekend, Kim was the nicest runner; she was nice all the time. Next was crazy Nathan. Every time he passed me, he had to say some crazy thing. But he was also very nice.

Once Nathan said to me, "Do you have a moment?" At that point I was walking and he was running. He continued, "I want to sing song for you."

I said, "That is fine."

His song was, "Oh, what a wonderful sponsor you are. I will owe it all to you." Then he sang it again. He had set a very nice tune to it, so I thanked him.

The funniest thing Nathan said was about meditation and contemplation. He asked me, "Do you meditate while you are walking and running?"

I said, "Yes."

He said, "I thought so. I can't meditate, but I contemplate." I said, "That is the highest state. That means you are higher than I am."

He looked at me and said, "It can't be higher than meditation." His wife is also very nice, but she does not act so crazy.

Before the marathon in Flushing Meadow Park, I ran about 14 miles on Union Turnpike. I was running in the outside lane and Pahar was running in the middle lane, next to me. My road crew was following me in the car. A policeman came and said, "Run on the sidewalk!" So I ran a little bit on the sidewalk, but the sidewalk is much harder than the street and it hurt my legs. Finally I said, "Let the police come again," and we went back to the street. Then an old man and woman saw us running. The old man was barking, "Can't you see you are running in the street?" The old lady told her husband not to bother us.

He ran another half mile before making a turn. When he came back from the small loop, he was in first place -- a hundred metres ahead of the runner behind him.

Databir went to the Super Runner store to buy me new running shoes. The owner, Gary Muhrcke, is an excellent runner who was the winner of the first New York Marathon. He knows me well. When he found out the shoes were for me, immediately he took off 20 percent.

Then Databir told him that I wanted to bring my weight down to 131 pounds to run the New York Marathon. Gary is five feet eight and a half inches tall and weighs 125 or 126 pounds. He said I should come down to 125 and then, to get strength, eat before the marathon and come up to 131. He also said I should not run more than 40 miles a week before the marathon. So I am listening to Gary Muhrcke's advice. I am trying to come down in my weight, and I will not run more than 40 miles a week.

Today the funniest thing happened when I was race-walking on 150th Street. On my way back, at about the 300-metre mark, a gentleman grabbed my elbow and said, "I have got to talk to you."

I thought, "O God, he is going to complain about the 300-metre mark on the street." That is the famous mark that a German lady has given us so much trouble about.

But the gentleman didn't mention the mark. He told me that his wife had gone crazy. He said, "You see the bus stop over there? She does not want to stand there. She wants the bus to stop for her about 40 metres away, not where the bus is supposed to stop. Three times the bus passed her but the drivers didn't stop, although she waved her hand and screamed."

He told me that the fourth time a bus was coming, to draw the bus driver's attention he stood in the street in front of the bus. The bus driver stopped and insulted and scolded him. While the bus was stopped, his wife entered into the bus.

I asked, "Now where is she going?"

He said, "She is going shopping."

I said, "How do you know she will not do some crazy thing while she is away? How do you know she will not stand at some place and expect the bus driver to stop for her?"

I gave him my very sympathetic ear, and he felt that I really was sorry for him. But he had faith in her and felt she would come back.

This week I ran along the New York Marathon route twice, going by car to different sections of the course. The first time, we went from the start to the thirteen-mile point so that I could run all the hills. Between the eighth and ninth mile is the worst hill. It is 1,200 metres long.

When I was in South Brooklyn, between the third and fourth mile, I saw a Puerto Rican gang that had been challenged by a black gang. The blacks were coming from behind me, and the Puerto Ricans were coming toward them. There were about four or five on each side, and I was running in between them!

The blacks had on the proper uniform -- all black. I was wearing a dark navy blue sauna suit that also looked black.

One of the Puerto Ricans showed the blacks such a big knife! I just smiled to myself and kept running, because I knew that the knife was not meant for me. The boys on the road crew also saw the knife. Dhanu got the shock of his life. What an experience!

I started out on the men's side. Then, when the men's and women's sides came next to one another, I went to the women's side. I thought that on the women's side people would be more civilised, but I was wrong. After a mile and half, they started throwing away the plastic garbage bags and all sorts of clothing they had worn to keep warm. Twice I almost slipped on the bags.

Afterwards I found out that when I went to the women's side, Chetana switched to the men's side, hoping to see me. She never saw me, but all the time she was seeing the boys from my road crew who were supposed to bring me water and run with me. She was seeing them, but from my side I couldn't find them at all. Two or three times I just stood still, only trying to see where the boys might be.

So many times I saw our disciples watching the marathon. But this side and that side I was looking for the road crew -- without success -- and they were also looking for me. For so many miles, ten or twelve boys were looking for me. I was running on the left side so I would not be blocked by people, but still they didn't see me.

When you want something and do not get it, it is very discouraging. Mile after mile went by but I did not see my road crew anywhere.

I didn't stop at all before 15 miles. Then I started walking and became cold. Thighs, legs, here, there everything became cold. And the road crew was nowhere to be found. It was very discouraging.

Finally, I saw Ranjana with some drinks for me, and soon after, at 17 miles, I saw the boys in my road crew.

She is now quite old. She started running at the age of 40. Her daughter inspired her. Before that she could not run even one block. That means she was not a faster runner than I was when I started. Now, in a few years she has become such a great runner. She is a world record holder for women over 40. So still I can have hope. The best thing for me is not to give up.

* The marathon spirit

Name and fame in marathon running was first won for America by Frank Shorter. Frank Shorter really shook America out of its lethargy or complacent feeling. It was he who made the start.

Now, people are running faster and faster. It will take at most five years, perhaps even less, for someone to run a marathon under two hours. How I wish that one of my disciples would do it! It is wishful thinking, but sometimes dreams come true. My disciples have an advantage because they have spirituality behind their running. If I were twenty years old, I would try it.

* Why do you get so exhausted?

The day before the marathon I was running on 150th Street. At about the 800-metre mark a dog came near me. The owner lifted his head and saw me. Then he became so excited. He shouted, "Sri Chinmoy!"

Three days ago I was doing intervals -- walking 100 metres and then running 300 metres. The same man saw me on 150th Street while I was walking. He asked me, "Why do you get exhausted so soon?"

He thought I was only walking.
