THE SIX-DAY RACE

At the six-day race, so many runners knew me. I smiled at them and they smiled at me. But my Cahit! He came off the track-he had to shake hands with me, talk to me and give me gifts. He couldn't believe that I gave him such a big gift.All the runners smiled at me, but he came off the track to see me.

Fred Lebow was all appreciation for our Marathon Team workers. He spoke to me most gratefully about our contribution.

The leader, a Greek named Yiannis Kouros, is something! Once he ran 200 miles at a seven-minute pace.

BRINGING SUNSHINE

Yesterday it was raining during the six-day race, so I left the track and went inside the car. Cahit came running to shake hands with me. He said that I bring sunshine to him. Then he said he was sorry he was unshaven. Where can I find another Cahit?

Sue Medaglia was so happy to see me at the race. She said, "Because of you, because of your group, I am alive, I am running."

Today I saw divine Kim, with folded hands. She was smiling and smiling. Such a soulful consciousness she maintained throughout!

THE OVER FIFTY CHAMPION

The man who won the special prize in the over-fifty category in our "Runners Are Smilers" race today is an excellent runner. He will always win, unless somebody else comes. He should bring all his friends by saying that he has got nice gifts. He should show them his trophy. Then his friends will come and challenge him. There is no other way.

HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE!

The first day I was in Los Angeles for the Olympics, I went out running early in the morning. I asked a man where the stadium was. He said, "Forget the stadium. Go have a cup of coffee!"

On another day, I was walking on the sidewalk when I saw three men-simply undivine- coming towards me. I jumped into the street to avoid them. Very loudly one said, "Jesus!"

In silence I said to him, "Thank you for invoking a very good friend of mine!"

Today in the mini-triathlon only Databir, Pahar, Pulak and Dhanu couldn't swim. In the big triathlon, they would be forbidden-we cannot afford to lose four or five lives.

On the boys' side Kripan was the best! Luckily Kripan was not driving; he was swimming. First he would go to one side, towards Anugata. Then he would go to the other side. His wife was screaming. How much time he was wasting going to this side and that side! He totally forgot about geometry.

When I was giving out oranges to the runners finishing our half-marathon in Flushing Meadow Park yesterday, some of them were mad. One fellow heard he was tenth or twelfth and his friend was eighth. I think his friend was also his rival. He was very disappointed and he said, "Damn it!"

Some runners didn't take oranges. One or two perhaps didn't like oranges, but others were mad at themselves. One or two, when they calmed down, came and took.

BLESSINGS FROM THE ELDERLY

During the race two or three runners were so nice to me. Some elderly runners were saying, "Guru, Guru!"

One of them was so happy. Another patted my shoulder with such affection. He was blessing me. He was running near me and then he went ahead.

This morning I ran four miles. The first mile I ran in 12:13. I said, "Great! Very near 13, my lucky number."

The second mile I ran in 10:21. I couldn't believe it! Instead of descending, I went faster. This was all because I got inspiration from Chidananda. After the first mile I saw Chidananda drive by in his car, and he was smiling like anything.

I said to myself, "Definitely he didn't meditate at six o'clock. Otherwise, he wouldn't be out at this hour." Sunirmalya was in the car with Chidananda. They were going to play tennis. Later Sunirmalya told me they had left the house at 6:16, right after meditation.

My third mile was 9:37. Then my fourth mile was 8:57.

After killing myself for some time, I saw no life inside my body. Then I saw Anne Alaimo 400 metres ahead of me. First I passed Chameli, then Anne, Godavari and Chandra. Then I passed Chetana long after them. But Sarama was beyond my reach.

During the race, at least fifteen people recognised me.

Of course, Trishul had been running for four days. He is planning to complete the 1,000-mile race. And Jason had also run more than 200 miles by that time.

STRUGGLING TOWARD 1,000 MILES

Originally I wanted to run seven miles every day during the 1,000-mile race. I felt that if I tried to do 13 miles, I would not be able to continue. But at the end of the race I had completed 208 miles-an average of 13 miles a day for the 16 days of the race.

Three people completed the full distance: 1,000 miles! Here is the proof that there are a few things the mind cannot understand-when the soul operates through the heart or through the vital. To run 1,000 miles is beyond the comprehension of the mind; the mind cannot imagine it!

Perhaps now people will be inspired to sponsor 1,000-mile races.

By the first week of August I do hope tocomplete my 1,000 miles. I am going on, going on. God knows if I can do it!

NAYAK'S SOUL PRECEDED HIM

The day before yesterday I was at the 800metre point on the 1,000-mile course, near the circle, walking. It was in the morning. All of a sudden Nayak's soul appeared for blessings. I thought, "Nayak didn't inform me he was coming to New York. Usually he informs me." But it was not actually Nayak, but only his soul, which appeared so vividly.

Then a few hours later I saw Nayak himself standing at the same spot, near the circle. He had come to New York quite suddenly on business.

MY IMAGINATION GETS FRIGHTENED

I have run a little over 200 miles during the 1,000-mile race, but already I am blessing my forefathers that I have promised to run 1,000 miles. Even my imagination gets frightened!

But I am sincerely proud of those who have completed the race. Look at Trishul! The race ended just yesterday, and already he is here at the meditation, enjoying his spiritual life.

In the afternoon I was walking to circus practice. On Snigdha and Sandhani's steps I saw three persons standing: Snigdha, Durga and a third person. So I smiled at them. Snigdha was pointing out the third girl to me, but I couldn't recognise her. I am blind! Then I saw it was Navina. Navina was with them, but her hairstyle had transformed her face.

That was the morning I had taken an oath that I wouldn't go very fast. After five minutes, I saw another lady. This one was running for the bus, and she also was passing me. I said, "This is too much!"

Then I walked very fast. I was on the street and she was on the sidewalk. I managed to pass her, but it made me very tired. Was it worth it? In three or four seconds, again she was going ahead of me. I asked myself, "Why did I compete with her?" Then I decided not to compete with her anymore.

TRICKING THE MIND

When I run mile after mile, I meditate. When I don't feel like meditating, I sing in silence. I have lists of songs that I play on the double bass, cello, violin, Moroccan instrument, Chinese instrument and harp. There are about 40 songs altogether. While running I sing each song inwardly, only once. In this way, when I go out of the house I kill three or four birds at once.

This morning at 7:00 I went four miles. I sang very soulfully, in a prayerful way.

When I walk, my mind says, "Once upon a time, you used to walk at an 11 or 13-minute pace. Now you are walking at a 17 or 18-minute pace." So the mind brings discouragement. But then I play a trick on the mind. I say, "Yes, it is a 20-minute pace, but I am gaining in another way. I am meditating longer."

At home I have millions of problems to deal with. In these 20 minutes when I am walking, I am all by myself; so I am very happy. If I take three minutes more, who cares? Nature is helping rue. With nature's beauty I am meditating. The mind brings discouragement, but then I tell my mind that for 20 minutes without interruption I am able to meditate. So the mind remains silent. We have to be super-smart when the mind wants to discourage us.

Today, first I walked two miles. Then I covered another eleven miles by running for 1400 metres and walking for the last 200 metres of each mile. I call this combination "running." Then I walked another half mile-for a total of thirteen and a half miles.

After the 1100-metre mark, near my seven-mile point, my hat was bothering me, so I took it off. Then I saw a beautiful lawn with a fence. I put the hat on one of the bars of the fence very nicely and left it in charge of God. I said, "God will take care of it. If it is His Will, He will keep it here."

Then I started jogging. After 40 metres I saw a gentleman smiling at me. God knows why he was smiling at me, but I also smiled at him. We were two gentlemen.

I went to the nine-mile mark and then started returning home. When I came to the seven-mile mark, I remembered that I had left my hat on the fence. I was about to look for it when I saw the same gentleman who had smiled at me holding the hat. He gave it to me and said, "I feel you are a nice man."

I said, "I know you are an excellent man!" Then he started laughing, and we shook hands.

This all happened right in front of his house. When I had left the hat there, at that time he had been 40 metres away. But when I came back, he was standing right in front of his house holding the hat. Can you imagine!

Mother Earth should bless me now!

I even feel the difference between the sidewalk and the street. The sidewalk is so much harder than the street. Even when I run on the track at St. John's University, the track hurts my legs.

In the ashram I used to go out running barefoot at four o'clock in the morning, and I wouldn't even notice that the ground was hard. Then when I went out at six o'clock, after it had become light, I would see pieces of glass in the places where I had been running. So the Supreme had saved me!

I spent lots of money-about $15. Then, after I had paid for everything, I wanted to buy four more of the little baseballs. The lady said, "They are 25 cents each."

I gave her a dollar. She took the dollar and then said, "But there is tax." Can you imagine? After I spent so much money, she had to ask me for tax on one dollar!

I never keep any change in my pocket, but I reached into my pocket and found a five-dollar bill. In the meantime, the lady put the first dollar I had given her into the register. When she gave me change for the five dollars, she gave me three dollars and some coins.

I said, "I gave you a dollar before."

She said, "Oh no, you didn't give it to me."

She had been holding it while I was getting out my five-dollar bill. In this world there are good people and bad people. She was very, very bad!

PERHAPS SHE THOUGHT I WAS TIRED

After buying the candy I started walking again. Near my four-mile mark I saw Atala the great in her car. She was smiling and smiling and inviting me to enter into her car. I said, "No, no!" Perhaps she thought I was tired.

PRASAD

After I saw Atala, I kept on walking. At my mile-and-a-half mark I saw Ranjana, Amita and Savita at the St. John's University track. I still had some candies with me, so I gave them the candies. Unfortunately, I had eaten a lot of the candies while I was walking.

THE NICE MAN

When I came to Parsons Boulevard, at my 1,000-metre mark, I was really tired! All of a sudden I heard a very frightening noise in the street. I was on the sidewalk, so I didn't have to worry, but I looked back.

There I saw that a red car had stopped very abruptly. A middle-aged man opened the door and started calling to me, "Sri Chinmoy, you are so tired! Please come into my car. I will give you a lift. I will be so honoured."

How abruptly he stopped the car! He was ready to have an accident just so he could offer me a ride. I don't think I have ever seen him anywhere before.

So God wanted me to have this experience. After seeing that bad lady in the candy store, I met this nice man.
