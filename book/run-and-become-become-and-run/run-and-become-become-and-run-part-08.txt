The other day I was doing hill work on 150th Street. Whom did I see? The great Australian runner Robert de Castella. He was planning to eat at Annam Brahma and he was doing some running before he went there.

* The boxer

This afternoon I walked five miles and then ran another three.

My five-mile walk was real fun! Databir was sleeping like anything in the car. But Vinaya was so good; he watched me every step of the way with his eyes wide open.

Baoul was driving. I was walking at random, looking for two-way streets so Baoul could drive alongside me. I had to always think of Baoul. I could walk anywhere, but driving was the problem.

We didn't follow any of my regular running routes, so I didn't know where the roads would lead us. It turned out to be uphill most of the way. As you know, I hate hill work. I was wearing six-pound weights on each leg. This is the kind of thing that boxers do to build up their legs. So I am another boxer.

The other day I used two-pound weights on my legs, then three. Gradually I will make progress and go up to seven and a half pounds.

After my walk, we drove to Flushing Meadow Park. I was going to run another three miles with the great runners Sushobhan, Databir, Pahar and Vinaya.

As we were driving to Flushing Meadow, the four boys ran while I watched from the car. Three of them were running at under a six-minute pace.

Databir has the tendency to race, and his first mile was a 5:42. Then, how he suffered! It was too much for him, so he entered into the car with me and did not get out again.

Vinaya was running even slower than a nine-minute pace. We were waiting for him to reach Flushing Meadow Park, but he was too slow. We had to go back to get him.

During our run together in Flushing Meadow, only Vinaya ran slower than I did. One person, at least, surrendered to me!

Today I ran five miles with the boys and then two miles on my own. When I was running with the boys on Main Street, some truck drivers started cutting jokes with us. They were standing next to their truck. As soon as they saw us running by at an eight-minute pace, they started jogging in place. Then they asked us, "Getting ready for the New York Marathon?"

Today I ran three short races in New Jersey. At the beginning of the first race, a mile-and-a-half fun run, some children were in front of me. Children don't run; they dance. One child absolutely wouldn't move out of my way. Very politely I touched his shoulder and passed him.

Then, one black man and I were fighting and fighting to go ahead of each other. Finally I went three or four metres ahead of him. That was the time I had to make a wrong turn. Three girls who were just ahead of me made a wrong turn, and I followed them. These three girls and others who took the "shortcut" didn't go back the right way. But the race director happened to come at the very moment that I made the wrong turn. So he shouted at me that I had gone the wrong way. I was the only one who went back the right way. By that time the black man was four or five metres ahead of me. After some time I caught him again. But in the end he finally defeated me. We had a very good competition. The girls who took the shortcut also defeated me.

* False encouragement

At one point in the first race Pratyaya made me feel that the goal was very near. She told me to go straight, but actually I had to make another turn. Then, in the last race, she screamed, "Just cross the road and you can see the end!" But the end was not in sight.

Databir also gives me false encouragement. In the second race today he was saying, "The end is very near." O God, I had to run about two hundred metres, and only then I saw the finish line way ahead of me.

Of course, these two and all those who cheer for me are only trying to encourage me. In a sense they do the right thing when they say these kinds of things. Encouragement comes and makes me feel that the goal is just in front of my nose.

* Time splits

  :END:


Third-class runners like me should not think of their timing. Even when you hear the timing, usually it is so slow that you do not get inspiration to go further. Sometimes in a two-mile race when you hear the time for the first mile you have the capacity to go faster. But in a marathon, at ten miles frustration starts because you are running so slowly. You are killing yourself, and then when you hear the time, you see it is so slow.

When I ran my best marathon in Toledo, Gayatri would tell me one timing and Peter would say something totally different. The funniest thing is that Peter was standing two or three metres farther along than Gayatri, but the timing he gave me was less than hers. Then I started getting annoyed -- who was giving the right splits? It turned out that Peter was giving the official timing and Gayatri had her self-chosen time. For four or five miles how I suffered because of the timing!

At the last race one man was so nice. He was a basketball player. After the race he came over to thank us for coming. The man was saying how young I looked and how unusual it was for someone my age to have such good speed. Niriha interviewed him. She became both a reporter and a camerawoman. Trishul missed his opportunity! He would have asked the basketball player so many questions.

* The competitive curse

  :END:


Sometimes when we run, we try to pass the runners who are ahead of us. But when they fall behind us, at that time pride does not come. We only feel miserable that we wanted to pass them in the first place. We wonder why we are killing ourselves. First we try to beat others. Then, when we go ahead of them, we curse ourselves for wanting to pass them. We feel it was better just to run behind them.

In one of today's races, at least six or seven runners passed me. Then, one by one, I passed them and went ahead again.

Today I ran three good races. It is all due to my disciples' encouragement. All those who were in the bus and others who accompanied me to New Jersey deserve my absolutely most powerful gratitude. Because of their silver inspiration, gold aspiration and diamond sacrifice, I was able to accomplish what I have done today. So these people deserve gratitude -- G-R-A-T-I-T-U-D-E -- in the purest sense of the term.

Today I was doing hill work on 150th Street. I was about to complete two miles when I saw the fat lady who used to have two dogs. Now she has only one dog; the other one died. The dog started following me. I knew the dog wouldn't bite me; she was only trying to lick my left knee. I stopped running and the lady said, "Don't be afraid of my dog. She is saying 'Good luck' to you!"

Quite often when I run, many songs appear inside my brain. This afternoon when I was running, two or three new songs came to my mind. Then, after I finished running, I had to sit down and notate the songs.

I will die, but I know my songs will live on. Indians, especially Bengalis, in every nook and cranny will sing my songs.

Today I ran four miles with Pahar in Flushing Meadow Park. So many silly and embarrassing things happened! Before I started, I put on heavy clothes -- shorts, trousers, plus the thick rubber belt I use to support my back. The first mile, as usual, was at my bullock-cart speed: 9:25. My timing for the next two miles was 8:18 and 7:40.

After the third mile I said, "Now I want to run a fast mile-seven minutes or under." I took off the rubber belt so that I could breathe more deeply. After two hundred metres, what happened? My trousers began falling off on my right side.

First I tried holding them up with my right hand, while I was still pumping with my left hand. Then they started falling down on my left side also. So I had to hold my trousers up with both hands. Whenever I let go, for a few seconds they would stay up and then they would fall down again. Because of this I could not run fast, so my timing was 7:50. Easily I could have gone faster! I forgot that I had on shorts underneath. I should have stopped and taken off my trousers.

The day before yesterday I ran seven and a half miles. After five and a half miles I came to the intersection where the Kew Motor Inn is.

It was about a quarter to eight in the morning. I was not in the middle of the street, but all of a sudden someone started honking. I looked around and saw a policeman on a motor bike. He was Puerto Rican. Since nobody else was around, I thought that perhaps I had done something wrong.

The policeman raised both hands and started screaming with joy, "Sri, Sri, Sri!"

I said to myself, "So, I have not committed any crime."

When I reached Main Street, I was about to make a left turn. Then I saw that a car had made a right turn and was waiting across the street. The driver -- a fat, black man -- was signalling me to come across. When I came near him, he said, "You are a very nice guy. I love you."

So, within eight hundred metres, I met two nice human beings, two really divine beings.

The first year I ran the New York Marathon in 1979, I became so tired after fourteen miles. Then I saw Lavanya. She was doing stretching exercises, but I didn't have the capacity even to bend. Then she went ahead.

As soon as I would come near Radha, she would take off. Then she would relax. When I would catch her again, she would run faster.

At the start of the 1979 Long Island Marathon I was taking such long strides because I was running with Bhashwar, Bhima and a few others. The first thirteen miles I ran so fast! If I had not walked the last three miles, I would have finished in under four hours.

The following year I ran only thirteen miles, and Lavanya skated the full twenty-six miles. I thought I was running behind Shephali and Savita, but afterwards I found out it was Shephali and Amy. All the time I was hiding and keeping behind them. Shephali didn't recognise me at all.

During the New York Marathon at least five people recognised me, although I was not wearing a Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team uniform. Some of them called out, "Keep going, keep going! Don't give up, Sri!" Some people were saying, "Go, Sri Chinmoy!" because Sushobhan, who was running with me, had on a Centre jacket.

Some of the 24-hour-race participants saw me and thanked me for the race. They are very nice people.

It is so funny! You pass people at fifteen or sixteen miles, smiling and smiling. Then, without any warning, cramps come later -- at about twenty miles. Then you have to stop and walk.

One policeman said to me, "You can't walk, you have to run." He was encouraging me to run, but I was dying.

I was in California for two and a half days. We had several races. In the two-mile race, I did nine seconds over my best two-mile timing: 13:51. In San Diego we had a four-hundred-metre race. My timing there was seven seconds more than my best four-hundred-metre timing. One of our Seattle disciples bragged that he was going to win the two-mile race. Then Astika defeated him badly. But he did come in second or third -- to everybody's surprise.

Then, when Bhashwar took our picture, I put my arm around him. His name is John.

He ran alongside me for at least three hundred metres. He said to me, "Guruji, I didn't know that you would be here. Otherwise, I might have run."

I told him, "Outwardly I could not contact you on your birthday, but I meditated on you inwardly." His birthday was the day before the New York Marathon.He said, "I thought of you on my birthday."

He said he was going to Honolulu to run the marathon on December 13th.

The first mile of the Philadelphia Marathon was no good. The road went up into the sky. After two or three hundred metres it went up, up, up -- like a building! As soon as I started the race, I had no life energy.

I am very tricky. I just run the course and if I don't complete it, I call it practice. Otherwise, if I take it too seriously, I suffer. I think, "Oh, I have to complete it." But this way I don't have to worry. I just start and do as many miles as I can.

* Pace problems

  :cite-key: RB:427
  :END:


Pahar has given me a schedule for seventy miles a week. Up to Saturday, it is possible for me to follow the schedule. With greatest difficulty I do it. But when Sunday comes, I am totally lost. How can I do twenty more miles in one day? I am not able to fulfil Pahar's desire. I stop at seven or ten miles, so it doesn't add up to seventy miles.

I feel that if I run very slowly, I will be able to run a higher mileage during the week. Sometimes before I start out, I am determined to run at a twelve-minute pace. Since it is an Indian bullock-cart pace, I think I will be able to run farther. But what happens is that I start at about a 10:15 pace. Then it becomes 9:50 and then 8:15. Each mile that I do in a good time gives me such joy. But by the time I reach five miles, I am finished.

The problem is that when I run at a ten-minute pace, it is boring. An eleven or twelve-minute pace is out of the question. It is not even running! But a nine-minute pace becomes too difficult. So I can't figure out what to do. One moment it is too slow, but if I speed up, the next moment I am completely exhausted.

While I was watching the Long Island Marathon, Ranjana was sitting in the car waiting for me when a policeman started bothering her. He asked her for her license and registration and took them into his car. When I came back I went up to the police car and acted disheartened and disgusted. I said, "Do anything you want to do, but do it quickly! You can fine us, but do it quickly!"

When I said that, he threw away the ticket. When I spoke to him, he calmed down and we didn't pay anything.

The second-best marathoner in the world now is our great friend, Robert de Castella. Yesterday he ran the famous Fukuoka Marathon in two hours, eight minutes and eighteen seconds -- only five seconds behind Alberto Salazar's world record.

While his wife was away in Canberra, he had to cook for himself. So he consulted our Sri Chinmoy Cookbook." He liked the recipe he used very much. So the world's second-best marathon champion eats our food. His father also likes us very much and reads my books.
