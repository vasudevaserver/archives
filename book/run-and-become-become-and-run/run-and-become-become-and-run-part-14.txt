* The midnight training run

I know my disciples will forgive me, but God won't forgive me for exploiting their devoted oneness by asking them to come at such an ungodly hour -- midnight -- to help me in my training run in Flushing Meadow Park last January.

The day before, of all days, I decided I would run seven miles during the day, although I knew that I would try to run a training marathon at night. Who asked me to run five or six miles? I did one mile of hill work up 150th Street in the morning. Then I ran two miles. Later I did one mile of speed work and one mile at an eight-minute pace. Then how I suffered during my long training run!

Was it my mental hallucination that it was so cold? Usually I go out at five in the morning, but it is not as cold as it was that night. At times I felt as if a bullet were passing through my chest. Then I stepped in a puddle and my left foot started burning. Inwardly I was screaming because my sock and shoe were burning with the absolutely icy cold! I always wear long underwear under my trousers, but that night I wore only a nylon running suit. Right from the beginning, the muscles in my legs were so cold. I wasn't wearing enough on my hands either, although I had on two pairs of gloves.

I said, "If I finish 20 miles, then I will be satisfied." I had already given up the idea of doing a whole marathon.

I am so grateful to each of the disciples who was there. All those who ran with me and those who sang throughout the night, standing at different places, were so compassionate. Hundreds of songs they sang. Each one deserves my very special gratitude. When they make such sacrifices for me, I hope they feel my heart's undying gratitude. If I have gratitude in any form, is it not for these disciples? Luckily I have them as my disciples. Had I been their disciple, I would have stayed in bed. I am speaking very sincerely. I would have said, "I am sick. I have got this to do, I have got that to do." Next time, if I do a midnight training run again, perhaps all of my disciples will say they have fallen sick. That is why they could not come.

* Attack by dogs

Early in the morning, around 5:30, I went out to run four miles. As I was running back, I was in my highest meditation. Right near my house, two huge, ferocious dogs -- no exaggeration -- came chasing after me from the other side of the street. They were barking and jumping up at me. One was right in front of me and one was on the side. One jumped right up to my chest and one was at my elbow. They were almost touching my chest and elbow -- it was a matter not of a foot but of inches. I couldn't jog, I couldn't walk. I had to use my occult power -- I still have some left -- so they wouldn't bite me.

For four miles I had been meditating, so was it my karma? You might say that perhaps the previous day I had done a bad meditation, but I knew for the past half hour what I had done. The mind was not thinking at all; it had not yet started with Centre problems. I was doing only prayer and meditation, but the hostile forces are all around. Luckily, my prayer-power saves me always. I was praying to the Supreme, "Save me, save me!" and the Supreme did save me.

Then I went onto my porch and was sitting on the couch watching the dogs. For three or four minutes I was on my porch looking at them and they were looking at me. One was brown and one was black and white. The brown one stood right in front of my house.

I called Ashrita, and he came with Tarak, Bipin and Pulin. I told them, "Please try to solve this dog problem!" Ashrita put a hole in his pants and blood on his arm and pretended he had been bitten. Then they went to complain to the lady who allows the dogs to stay behind her house. They also went to the police.

Four months ago I had the same experience. It is not like silly barking. These dogs are really attacking! This has been happening again and again with the same two dogs. They always come chasing after me from behind this lady's house. The lady says they are not hers, but she and her husband won't let anyone take the dogs away.

A few months ago I was going down the street and five or six dogs came. What are you going to do? I wanted to enter into the house of the old lady who is my friend. I stood in front of her house, hiding behind a tree. I said, "O God, this is the time for me to knock on her door -- at 4:30 in the morning!" I was about to knock on her door, but then the dogs went away.

This time I didn't get a chance even to stop. If you see them five or ten metres ahead, you can pretend you are walking and maybe they won't attack. But this time I didn't have a chance to stop, because the dogs came from behind. The best thing is to have something in your hand. One time I looked for something and found a ball, so I pretended it was a rock.

This morning I went out running in shorts. It was so bad outside -- raining cats and dogs! On the sidewalk there were so many puddles!

The rain was falling like arrows, but I still ran two miles.

During our 12-hour walk, some of the walkers were looking at my picture. I thought they were reading. At 3:30 in the morning, when I saw Agraha go by holding something in his hand, I thought he was learning songs. I knew he was not a singer, so I wondered why he was learning songs. No, he was looking at my picture for inspiration.

For some people to do something on the physical plane is such a difficult task! I am the pioneer. I walked 19 miles today. I am extremely proud of myself. The first time I stopped after eight laps. The next time I did five laps, and then I did six. So it came to 19. If I could have continued from the beginning to the end, I could have done 30 miles.

Because I was tired, he sympathised with me.

Last night I ran four miles and walked two miles. Then we drove six miles in the car.

Databir's calculations were going wrong because his mind was not functioning. Indian kindergarten students could have done better arithmetic. Mentally I knew he was wrong. I was writing the figures on a paper plate and calculating mentally. His calculations were three or four seconds off.

Just as I finished writing my calculations, I saw Anugata's soul inside the car. I smiled at the soul and blessed it. Then, not a minute later, Databir told me that he had written down a message from Anugata on the other side of the plate.

Anugata had called the previous night from California to say he had found a place on Long Island that has a belt to support my back. The place has 24-hour service, so Databir and Pulin had phoned up the place. It was 2:30 in the morning. Today they will go to get the belt.

Last night Anugata's soul had also come to me for special blessings and love. Perhaps the soul had come to me right after he had finished talking with them. And this morning, when they were about to tell me that he had called, his soul came a second time. So this is our oneness with the soul.

Pulak's running style is unique! Then comes Saurya's style -- he wants to touch the ceiling with his head while running.

The other day I saw Sudhir running early in the morning. His hands were stretched straight out.

Once, while race-walking, Baoul looked as if he was doing archery with his arms.

Then I heard the clock say, "It is three a.m." so powerfully. Every hour this clock announces the time. I said, "I am not going running yet, I want to hear it say another hour."

Again at 4:00 it was so faithful. It said, "It is four a.m." But I was just sitting there, praying and praying for God-realisation. Then it became 5:00. I started getting ready, doing a few stretching exercises. At exactly 5:30 I phoned up Databir. In ten minutes he found me with his car. He always catches up with me on Union Turnpike.

Five minutes later the actual neighbour came out of his house and said "Good morning!" to me. Then he entered into the same car. So I said, "Good morning." The first one was my neighbour's brother perhaps, but I thought it was him.

When I see children giving out water, I never look at their fingers. Children are God. But with grown-ups, I look at their fingers first before taking the water.

Always you have to take advantage of the situation. If I want to run on 150th Street, I can do it again and again and again. But during the trip to Yonkers, I will write poems and do many things, whereas I may not get inspiration at that hour to write poems in my house. So I force myself to go to Yonkers to run the four-mile hill course there.

It usually takes 45 minutes to drive there. Today it took one hour and fifteen minutes. While in the car, I could have slept, played my flute or read the newspaper. But I took the opportunity to dictate poems. Everything can be a blessing! You can have a comfortable life and stay home and accomplish nothing. But each time I go to Yonkers I can dictate 40 or 50 poems.

James and Arpan were running together. Both of them were in a very good consciousness, and they smiled at me very soulfully. Then Trishul passed by me, not even one foot away, almost dashing into me, but he did not even see me.Databir was forty metres away from me. He saw Databir and said, "Hi." Then he saw me and stopped, smiled and folded his hands

When Nathan saw me, he said, "Sri, I have something to tell you. I am studying your books."

At the 100-mile race Arpan was so excited because he got number 27, which is the day of my birthday.

Nathan doesn't like to talk to people when he is very exhausted. At 74 miles he said, "These people, what are they telling me? They should come and start a marathon in my state." He had 26 miles left. But when he came near me, he smiled at me and his mood changed.

The great Stu Mittleman was hit by a bicycle at midnight. He was jolted. Of all people, he was the one who had to be attacked!

Seven women joined the race. Four finished. Many men also gave up. The runners had to have completed a 50-mile race before this.

They gave us a very big prize, a plate, because Arpan, James and Trishul won the 50-mile National Team Championship.

At six in the morning George Vallasi ran over to greet me.

I was shivering. It was so cold, and Baoul didn't have any jacket in his car. It was foggy and drizzling.

George told us that many excellent runners say that they used to dream night after night about baseball. But we have created so much interest in running that people are losing interest in baseball. Running is giving them so much joy that they are no longer interested in baseball.

Nathan Whiting said he has read thousands of poetry books, but he has never read anybody who writes in the English language in such a natural way as I do.

I had told in that I liked his poetry book, so he told me that.

I said, "Nathan!"

He said, "Yes, I mean it!"

* Watching the six-day race

During the six-day race, a runner from Colorado came up to me and said, "Sri, I always feel for you. Whenever other people misunderstand you, I say, 'His philosophy is totally different.' I read your books.

"My wife is so nice. She says, 'As long as you don't get injured, you can run.' After eight days I am running another six-day race."

Then, after some time, he said to me, Sri, you have inspired me so much that I have already run three miles."

Cahit Yeter came up to me and said, I took a long rest, and as soon as I opened my eyes, I saw you." I hadn't seen him.

As soon as Stu Mittleman saw me, he started clapping. Don Choi gave me a little smile.

Kim Cavanough calls me "Guru " She said, "Guru, this is one of your races. Your people have made it into your race. I am getting the same feeling here as at your races."

Nathan Whiting came by and I said, "I have read the article about you."

Nathan said, "I have not read it."

I said, "It is excellent."

Nathan was begging me to give a spiritual name to James. Nathan is always so nice o me. I asked him how he survives. He said, "Oh, a difficult task! I work a little and then I run."

George Vallasi was also in a clever way trying to get me to give James a spiritual name. He was saying that James was not talking to the cameramen and that he himself wanted to speak to the camera people on James' behalf. So he asked me what he should say -- what James' good qualities are.

When I was coming back from running today, I saw X. He was going straight and I made a turn.

O God, X's third eye is not open, so he could not see Y's wife, Z, standing right in the middle of the street. Her soul had come to me for blessings.

As I was coming back from running, I saw Ranjana driving to practise sports. As she passed I looked at my watch. I said to myself, "Perhaps she is thinking that she is late, and that is why I am looking at my watch." But actually, I was looking to see how long I had been out.

I feel such joy and such sorrow when I see the disciples running early in the morning on 150th Street, trying to lose weight.

The other day, first I saw Anupadi. I said, "Good!" Then I saw X. As soon as she saw me, she increased her speed. I said, "O God, she can run so fast!"

All are dying to lose weight!

At our West Coast triathlon, I was supposed to draw a number in a kind of lottery. It was read out over the loudspeaker -- number 644.

The woman with that number could not hear; she was almost deaf. A man did something with his fingers, and then she understood. Then she came up and became speechless because she had won. So the deaf became dumb.

Then she said that she had been dying to go to Hawaii, and now she had got the round-trip ticket free. Over 700 people joined and she won the ticket!
