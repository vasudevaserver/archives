Two Puerto Rican boys were in a car driving the wrong way on a one-way street as I came running down. One boy said, "Hi, Shry, Shry, Shry. I love you." The other boy said, "Hi, John McLaughlin. I love you."

Along one of my running routes a little girl of five or six and her father were entering into a car. The father was getting into the driver's side and the daughter was getting in the other side. As I ran by, the daughter said, "Hi, Guru!"

The father said to her, "Call him by his real name: Sri Chinmoy." Then he said to me, "I have no objection to her calling you 'Guru', but I just wanted her to know your real name. We have some tenants who always talk about you."

When I went out running I saw a short, thin, old man with a hat and cane sitting on the edge of a wall, waiting for the bus. I didn't pay any attention to him, but when I came back from my seven-mile run, the same old man was still waiting there. He said to me, "How I wish I could get back my youth."

I said, "I too miss my youth."

"How old are you?" asked the man.

"Forty-eight," I answered.

"I am seventy-three," said the man.

I stayed there with him for two or three minutes and then I finished my run.

While I was running about four or five days ago, I passed a man who was giving a parking ticket to a car -- God knows what he is called. I was very tired, and when he saw me he said, "Young friend, you have run enough. Now take rest."

After writing out the ticket, he himself sat down at the foot of a tree. He was a very old man, a very nice soul. I asked him, "Do you get joy by giving tickets to cars?"

"No, never!" he replied. "But will you give me my bread and butter? Daily I have to give at least ten or twelve tickets in the morning. If I do not, then my boss will fire me. He will not give me my bread and butter."

So we sat down and both rested for about five minutes -- this is how I run -- and then we went our own ways.

Yesterday when I was finishing a six-mile run on 150th Street, a young boy came up to me and said, "Nice style, but you need longer strides."

He began demonstrating, saying that after each stride I should pause and press the ground with my toes. "In this way your stride becomes longer."

He was very nice and demonstrated this for two minutes or so. I did not tell him that I know all the different stride techniques.

Around 4:30 in the morning, after running three and a half miles, I passed a very old man who was in his seventies. He was carrying a bag which had some food inside it. This happened between Queens Boulevard and Main Street.

He asked me, "Excuse me, which way is the subway?"

I said, "I'm very sorry. I don't know."

The old man said, "Never mind, you are a nice guy."

After I went on about 200 metres, I remembered: "Oh, he is walking towards the highway. How is he going to get the subway there?"

So I ran back to get him. O God, he was coming back; somebody else had already told him to head towards Queens Boulevard.

But when he saw I came back to help him, he said, "I knew you were a nice guy."

* How the world exists

There are bad people, there are good people and there are very good people on earth. I don't care for pizza at all, but some of my disciples enjoy pizza like anything. A few months ago I said, "Let me please my disciples!" So I went to the pizza parlour and asked for eight pieces. The man asked me to take a whole pie. It would be a matter of ten minutes, he said, for him to get it ready.

Instead of waiting in the hot pizza parlour, I went outside to do some jogging. After thirteen minutes I went back inside.

The man didn't have it ready yet. He said, "I didn't trust you. I thought you wouldn't come back." So I waited there, and in five minutes he gave me a pie to take home.

Yesterday I was running while some of the girls were working in the Jharna-Kala Store. Since I know my disciples like baklava, I entered into a store that sold it and asked the man if he could cut twenty pieces in half. He said yes and started cutting. He had cut only two pieces when I told him I would be back. Then I ran a mile and a half.

When I returned, the man was surprised to see me. He said, "I am giving this to you for fifty cents less because I am so surprised to see you." In his case I was late, but he had it ready for me.

He asked me for ten dollars. I said to myself, "Each piece is 40 cents and there were twenty pieces." Fortunately, a lady standing behind me said to the man, "That should be eight dollars." The man said, "Oh, yes, yes. Sorry."

Now we come not to better but to best. Three weeks ago I received an anonymous letter deeply appreciating what I am doing for mankind, along with a bank check for one thousand dollars. It was a check from Citibank, but for some reason it had been mailed from Maine. So there are, indeed, good people on earth. This is how the world exists. Otherwise, the world would collapse.

Sometimes someone is ten or twenty metres ahead of you in a race. If you look at that person, you see that he is running so slowly. You can't believe that you are running slower than him, but you are.

In our last ten-mile race, two older women were running near me. Who will feel sorry for whom? But they finally went ahead of me, even though they seemed to be going so slowly, and I couldn't catch up to them again.

I will never allow the Centre to sponsor a race with the same kind of hilly course that we had in today's ten-mile race. Even my road crew driving alongside me in a car knew what we were going through. Each mile had at least one hill or even more, and there were three hills that were almost insurmountable.

When I saw one particular hill, my reaction was immediately to collapse. Then I saw two of my girl disciples running together in front of me, literally running and jumping up the hill.

I said, "If they can jump like that, why can't I drag my body up the hill?" And I did finally reach the top.

The day before yesterday I was running by the Indian grocery near our old gym. An Indian family was standing beside the grocery. As I came by, a young boy of eight or ten began calling his mother, "Mom, look, Sri Chinmoy is running, Sri Chinmoy is running! We haven't seen him for a long time."

He called his mother, but I had disappeared before she could come out of the store.

This morning at 4:30, when I made a turn off 150th Street onto the Grand Central service road at the half-mile mark, I passed a very thin, old man who was half drunk and very dirty.

He said to me, "I can beat you walking." I smiled at him. Then he started walking very fast for forty metres, but I was still a little ahead of him.

Then I told him, "/You/ run. I can beat you walking."

So he started running and I started walking. I stayed behind him deliberately; otherwise, I could have easily defeated him.

He said, "Oh, now we are even." He could not defeat me when he was walking and I could not beat him when I was walking.

This morning a fat lady, my neighbour-friend, was standing with her two dogs near my house. She saw me run by and then she started walking slowly across the street. By the time she reached the other side, I was back from running around the block. She said, "You run so fast. One, two, three, and you are here!" She could not cover fifteen metres in the time I took to run 400 metres.

At four in the afternoon, after running a half-mile, I stopped for two seconds in front of an old man, an invalid who was sitting in a wheelchair in front of his house.

He said to me, "Don't stop, don't stop! It is not allowed. Keep going, keep going. Don't stop, it is not allowed."

I thanked him, and then I ran a mile and a half. When I was returning, I thought that the old man would still be there and give me the same advice. So about 100 metres before his house, I stopped for a few seconds and thought of him. Immediately I saw a flash and heard him say in the inner world, "That's perfect."

When I saw him 100 metres later, I smiled and he said, "That's perfect." He didn't know that I had stopped 100 metres before.

When I was running the day before yesterday, I felt such tiredness in my body. The body was so undivine, not receptive at all. After 200 metres, I stopped for no rhyme or reason. After 400 metres, again I stopped. This time I got mad at myself. "Is it tiredness or is it something else?" I asked.

Inwardly I said a few times, "I am not going to stop, I am not going to stop." Then I began chanting out loud, at every step, "No, never! No, never! No, never!" In this way I covered one mile. If people had heard me chanting in the street, they would have said: "Insane!" Luckily, no one was around. Then I ran all the way back home, feeling quite happy.

Early yesterday morning around seven o'clock, as I was running towards Parsons Boulevard, I saw an elderly man sitting on a chair across the street. As I came by he raised his hand and said to me, "Hey, your style is beautiful. You look beautiful. You are beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!"

When I came back from running around 7:30, one of the disciples came to my house to drive me to the playground. As soon as she opened the door and saw me on the porch she said, "Guru, you look so beautiful!" She used the same words as the old man. So in silence I blessed the soul of my laundress for my beautiful outfit.

In the afternoon at three o'clock I was running along the street near the turn-off to Guru Stationery. Many children were coming home from school at that time.

A little girl, eight or nine years old, said to a little boy, "Look, look, Shry is running!"

The boy said, "His name is Sri."

The girl said, "He runs like an old man."

The boy said, "He is not old."

The girl said, "But he runs like an old man."

After I had run 400 metres more, I saw a group of boys standing opposite one of my disciples' houses. One white boy was so excited to see me running. "Oh, Sri Chinmoy!" he said.

A black boy said, "No good, he takes away everybody's money."

The white boy said, "No, my father said he is a saint like our Christian saints. He never charges any money."

I didn't want to enter into their conversation, so I just kept going.

At night, one of my disciples was driving us along the route where one of my spiritual daughters, A., was going to run thirteen miles the next morning, so we could leave bottles of water there. She was saying that she wanted to get rid of all her old running shoes. Another of my spiritual daughters, B., who was in the car with us, said, "Why do you have to get rid of them? There will be many people to buy them." But she used some American slang expression.

A. said, "Nobody will buy my shoes."

B. said, "Why don't you give them to Casey to sell in his flea market? People will be happy to buy running shoes at a cheap price."

A. put bottles of water at the three-mile, five-mile and six-mile marks. On the bottles it was written, "This bottle is for a runner. Please do not remove!" or something like that.

The next morning A. was supposed to start running at six o'clock. At five o'clock I was out running along the same route. A little before the three mile mark, I said to myself, "Let me go and see whether the bottle is still there." I knew she had put it near the sidewalk at the base of a drinking fountain. I stopped there to look, but the bottle was not there. "Wonderful, wonderful" I thought sadly. "Somebody has removed it."

I was about to start running again on the street when one of my inner beings said, "My Lord, please run on the sidewalk." I didn't ask why. After 100 metres, right at the 1,500-metre mark on the sidewalk, I saw the bottle standing straight up. Someone had removed the bottle and put it on the sidewalk. Had my inner being not asked me to run on the sidewalk, I would not have seen the bottle since it was quite dark.

I picked up the bottle and ran back to put it in the original place. Then I continued my run.

At the four-mile mark I saw a middle-aged, innocent looking lady in trouble. She was having problems with her Volkswagen and had opened the hood. She said, "Can you give me a hand?"

O God, I know nothing about cars. I said, "I know nothing about mechanics, but please wait. In ten minutes I will be able to send you my chauffeur." She didn't understand my English, so I said, "My driver, my driver."

Then I began running quite fast to look for a telephone booth to call the disciple who drives me around. After 200 metres, I saw an ambulance driver asleep in his ambulance. As soon as I passed him he woke up and said, "Hey, such a beautiful, cool morning. Don't you know how to enjoy sleep? You woke me up."

I said, "Friend, can you do me a favour? A girl is having trouble with her car."

He said, "Pretty girl?"

I said, "Middle-aged lady." This man was a real joker. I never carry money when I run, but this time I happened to have seven dollars with me. I gave him the money, and the seven dollars talked. He immediately turned on the motor and made a wrong turn down a one-way street heading towards the lady. When I saw him finally talking to the lady, I said, "Now I have done my part. He is a joker, but he will fix her car." So I continued running.

I said, "I enjoy it."

He asked, "Where are you going?"

I answered, "Somebody has put water at this spot to drink."

The policeman said, "Don't you want to drink it? Aren't you thirsty?"

I said, "No, I am not thirsty."

"Go home and sleep," he said.

When I had run another mile and a half, I stopped for a second or two. Immediately a tiny dog came and sat by my right foot, wanting me to caress it and give it a little kindness. I never do this kind of thing, but this time I bent a little to touch the dog's head. The owner, who was bald-headed, wearing a grey coat, came over to me and said, "My Dolly has fallen in love with you."

I kept caressing the dog. The owner said, "Dolly, do you want to become a great runner like this gentleman?"

I said, "How I wish I could become a great runner!"

His older brother said to him, "Don't say that. He is a very great man."

The younger one said, "My daddy is far greater."

The older boy said, "Our daddy is not as great as he is."

The younger one said, "No, he is just showing off."

"Don't say that, don't say that, don't say that!" the older one told him.

When I was coming back after covering one mile, the two children were still playing. The little one again said to me, "You are just showing off. Go home, go home!"

The older brother got furious and shouted, "Don't say that! Don't say that! Don't say that!"

As I was running by Queensboro Hall, a very big building on Queens Boulevard, I saw a priest crossing the street in front of me. He was about 60 years old and wearing a black robe. Suddenly he said, "Damn you!"

I stopped and said, "Father, why do you swear?"

The priest said, "Why not? All the time I see people like you running, running, running. Why don't you run inwardly? You don't believe in Heaven? By running in the street, do you think you will be able to go to Heaven?"

I was in a joking mood so I said to the priest, "I will find Heaven everywhere except inside your tongue."

He said, "Who are you, after all?"

"I am an ordinary man," I answered. "As you see, I am just a runner."

The priest said, "Why do you have to run?"

I said, "I am getting ready for the New York Marathon."

"You dark fool!" he shouted. "Look at your head, look at your head."

"It seems I have more hair than you," I said.

He said, "Like you, thousands and thousands of fools will be running in the New York Marathon. Go back to your running. I shall pray for your salvation."

I said, "Perhaps you need salvation more desperately than I do."

Then the priest swore again, "Damn you!" and crossed himself.

The journey to Greece, where I was going to run the marathon, took about nine hours. For me to sit for that long on a plane --  especially with my right leg problems -- was a difficult task. At one point, I got up to go to the bathroom. I was standing in line for about fifteen minutes but the line did not move. So very gently I was stretching my right leg while standing.

An elderly lady saw me and came up to me. "I am sure you are going for the marathon," she said. "Look, my husband too is going for the marathon."

Then she called her husband over and introduced me to him. I had a long talk with him. He came from Cleveland, and this was going to be his seventeenth marathon. Sixteen times he had run, but this was going to be his first time in Greece. He told me his time in his first marathon was 4:17. Now he does it in three hours or 3:15.

He was advising me to do hill work. "You must do hill work if you want to become a good runner. Nobody can become a good runner without doing hill work. If you want to increase your speed, if you want to strengthen your legs, if you want to have long strides, then hill work is the only answer."

I thanked him deeply.

Then he said, "I am going to run. I come from Philadelphia."

I said, "Philadelphia gave me a very sad experience. I went to Philadelphia to run the marathon."

He said he was also there and gave up after thirteen miles. I said, "At twenty-one miles I gave up."

So in the same marathon where I gave up after twenty-one miles, he gave up after thirteen miles.

He had run one other marathon somewhere else, he told me; his timing was five and a half hours. So my ego came forward. I said, "I am not so bad." O God, in two more days what would happen!

Then we talked for a long time. Since my timing is a little better than his, I felt quite at ease talking to him.

Then the Cleveland man came up and joined our conversation. He was very sincere; he was not bragging, only advising us what to do.

My first evening in Greece I went out to run. It seems that taxi drivers and car owners there are insane, especially at night. How badly they drive!

At every moment you are at their mercy, even in the park. I don't know how, but they manage to drive right into the park itself. There is no street or anything; far from it. But they drive right into the park, and so speedily. Then they leave their cars there while they go to a party or some place. And we are trying to run there!

Inside the park an old Japanese man -- very short, very skinny -- started following me as I was running. I thought I was shorter than the shortest, but he was practically at my shoulder. And he was very old.

With such affection, such affection, he started running with me. Then we started talking. He told me all about his running experiences. I was very happy.

He was about 70 years old and he said he had come all the way from Japan for the marathon.

He was staying at the same hotel that I was. There were quite a few Japanese staying there. They all had come to run.

The following day also we ran together. I always make complaints about my strides, but his strides were shorter than mine. I ran two miles with him, very slowly.

I saw him once more after the marathon. He took seven hours and fifteen or twenty minutes. He was so delighted that he had completed it. Who would not be proud of him!

Later that day, which was the day before the marathon, I took a cab and went to the marathon starting point. I was disappointed, frightened, to say the least, when I saw the whole course.

I said, "Since I came all the way, best thing is to die on the battlefield."

But when you are in the car, the battlefield is not a real battlefield. Only when you start running, when you are on the ground, is it a real battlefield.

When I saw it in the car, I still had a little hope that I would be able to manage it. Secretly I had a little hope that I would be able to finish it. O God, the actual day was something else!

It was so hot -- really very, very hot. Everybody had told me that the weather would be very cold. But no, it was really hot.

So my Cleveland friend said, "Drink a lot, drink a lot; otherwise, you won't be able to make it."

After two miles there was a loop that brought you back again to the main road. Look at their divine stupidity! Instead of making the loop cross the main road further up, they brought it back so it overlapped the first part of the route.

Some were running at a five-minute pace, and others were running at a 13-minute pace. So the fast runners who were finishing the loop were blocked by the slow runners who hadn't reached the loop. They could not go fast because we were blocking the way. I felt sorry for them.

After two miles I saw my Cleveland friend. I was only 200 or 300 metres inside the loop, and he was completing it. He was practically 1,200 metres ahead of me. He had made the loop, but he was being blocked by the slow runners. He was almost furious. I don't know, but his face was not normal at that time. Even then, when he saw me he waved. I was so grateful to him.

Now the fool in me -- I don't know how or why -- also started running fast. When it was three miles, my time was under 21 minutes. I said, "Is it possible?"

When I completed the loop, I looked back and, O God, there were so many people behind me -- hundreds of people. At that time all my pride came to the fore! "I am a great runner, because so many people are behind me." I thought some had not even come to the loop. "I am completing three miles and, God knows, still they haven't completed two miles." And at least 300 or 400 were way ahead; God knows where they were.

But I felt sorry for the excellent runners, because they had to cross through the bad runners like us. We were disturbing them on the way.

As soon as I reached five and a half miles, I saw the first hill. For at least 1,200 metres it went up. It was not yet six miles, so still I had strength.

The next 200 metres were not downhill but flat, and then again it went up for practically half a mile. Next it went down -- this time not even for 100 metres -- and again up.

Like this, when I came to nine miles, I felt miserable. I said, "What am I going to do?" Luckily, at that time it went downhill for about 800 metres. I was so delighted, so happy; at last there was an oasis in the desert.

O God, after 800 metres it went up again.

From five and a half it started, and for the next fourteen miles it was only hills. And you won't believe me, but there were no downhills. At most it would be flat for 100 or 200 metres and then it went up, up, up. There were three hills that were at least, /at least/, one mile long.

People were cursing and dying.

One young man was lying right on the street -- not on the sidewalk but right on the street -- massaging his knee and saying, "Never in this lifetime will I run again." Terrible! Terrible!

Some were running fifty metres and walking fifty metres. You won't believe it, but three elderly men walked faster than I could run. I was running -- "Huh, huh!" -- and they were walking, but my running was not as good as their walking.

One of them was mischievous enough to laugh at me. He was laughing at me because I was running and he was beating me while walking. But after two miles I saw him; he had become so tired that he went to drink ERG or water, and he did not appear for a long time.

There were runners poorer than me. I felt sorry for them. And the people who were going ahead of me, I was admiring like anything. No jealousy, absolutely none! I was adoring them. It was an impossible task they were performing.

Sometimes old people -- at least ten or fifteen years older than me -- were going ahead of me. There was no competitive spirit on my part; only my admiration was coming forward. "These people are older than me and look how they are doing." They had such short strides -- about half the length of my strides -- but quick, quick, quick.

I didn't have the capacity to go ahead of him, and I didn't want to decrease the little speed that I had. So I said, "No, let me go at my own pace."

For about three miles, he went on making that noise. Then afterwards he disappeared. He didn't go ahead of me; perhaps he stopped running.

At eighteen miles my first attack came: my hamstring revolted.

When it was twenty-one miles, out of the blue, five songs I heard all at once. It was absolutely a chorus; the music was on! How can I get five cramps at a time? The pain was excruciating. I was helpless, flat, dead! Some of the disciples were helping me. One of them was seated and, with a sponge, was pressing my leg with cold water, while another was pushing my toes forward. How hard, how quickly, the first one was massaging me! And afterwards, four or five times he did it again. Even now it frightens me when I think of the pain -- excruciating!

After that experience I started walking. Slower than the slowest, a quarter mile I walked. Again the pain, so again I walked.

Running is forbidden now. Just walk, walk as slowly as possible. When it was twenty-three miles, another new friend came -- right here in the neck. I couldn't breathe in; neither nostril was functioning.

O God, this was really unbearable! With the previous pain, at least I was able to breathe in, so I felt that there was something going on. But when it started in this muscle, I was not able to breathe even. Too much, too much!

Some people -- I think, nurses -- came up, but we didn't take their help. I said, "I have got my help."

When it was twenty-five miles, a strong desire arose: "Oh, let me run at least the last mile." It was a desire, nothing else. As soon as I tried, all the cramps said to me, "Where are you going? We are still alive." Such pain!

I thought 800 metres, 400 metres, 100 metres I would run. Finally, when it was only twenty metres, the officials were asking me to run. I tried, but I knew if I had run, I would have dropped right there and fainted, so I just dragged myself. I wasn't even walking -- just dragging my body. Anyway, I managed to finish.

The management of the race was far from perfection. Sometimes the water stations were on the right side of the street, sometimes they were on the left side. It didn't bother me, because my disciples were supplying me with ERG. But others I saw. Sometimes they were running on this side of the street and they had to cross to the other side.

And a horrible thing! They allowed the vehicles to run along the same route. After eleven miles it was so difficult to run. When we had only six miles left, we had to run in the city of Athens. There it was infinitely worse.

You are running this way when, all of a sudden, from the side street cars will enter. Policemen hold the runners and let the cars pass. Here we are dying to reach the destination one minute sooner, and the policeman will say: "Stop!"

Now, one of the boys was wise. He saw a diner. So he said, "I wonder if they have hot chocolate." Three of them stopped and had a hot chocolate, and then we started running again. The disciple who had said he was tired was running behind us. All of a sudden he became inspired and started going ahead. So I barked at him. "Either run fifty metres behind me or ahead."

* Editor's preface to the first edition

Sri Chinmoy's interest in running dates back to his youth. At the ashram, or spiritual community, where he lived from the ages of 12 to 32, he was the top-ranked sprinter and, for two consecutive years, decathlon champion. It wasn't until the fall of 1978, however, that he first became interested in long-distance running. Since then, he has pursued the sport with the same one-pointed intensity that he has brought to his various literary, artistic and musical pursuits. For Sri Chinmoy, running -- like writing, painting and composing -- is nothing but an expression of his inner cry for ever-greater perfection: perfection in the inner world and perfection in the outer world. "Our goal is always to go beyond, beyond, beyond," he says. "There are no limits to our capacity, because we have the infinite Divine within us, and the Supreme is always transcending His own Reality."

Sri Chinmoy regards running as a perfect spiritual metaphor. "Try to be a runner and go beyond all that is bothering you and standing in your way," he tells his students. "Be a real runner so that ignorance, limitations and imperfections will all drop far behind you in the race." In this spirit he has inspired countless individuals to "run" -- both literally and figuratively.

"Who is the winner?" he writes in one of his aphorisms. "Not he who wins the race, but he who loves to run sleeplessly and breathlessly with God the Supreme Runner." As a fully God-realised spiritual Master, Sri Chinmoy has consecrated his life to this divinely soulful and supremely fruitful task. At the same time, on an entirely different level, he has made some significant contributions to the sport of running. He was the inspiration behind several long-distance relays, including a recent 300-mile run in Connecticut and the 9,000-mile "Liberty-Torch" run through all the states held during the 1976 Bicentennial. He has composed several running songs, which his students have performed at a number of races. His students have sponsored Sri Chinmoy Runs throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia as an offering to the running community. Moreover, Sri Chinmoy has encouraged his followers around the world to take up running as a means of overcoming lethargy and increasing their spiritual aspiration on the physical plane. Two hundred of his disciples, for example -- most of whom were novice runners -- completed last years's New York City Marathon.

In the year he has been running, Sri Chinmoy himself has completed seven marathons. He averages about seventy to ninety miles a week, with most of his running done late at night or in the early hours of the morning. During his runs he has been chased by dogs, accosted by hooligans, greeted by admirers and cheered on by children. Sometimes he has had significant inner experiences; other times he has suffered deplorable outer experiences. As a spiritual Master of the highest order, Sri Chinmoy views these experiences -- both the divine ones and the undivine ones -- with a unique perspective. The running world is nothing but the human world in microcosm, and Sri Chinmoy's reminiscences stand as a remarkable commentary on the whimsical, poignant, funny, outrageous and, above all, supremely significant experience we call life.
