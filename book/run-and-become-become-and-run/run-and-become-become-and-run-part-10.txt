Today I ran fifteen miles in the Boston Marathon. Among the disciples, Abadh was the first one I saw. He was standing at the six-minute-pace section. I was tempted to join him, but I was afraid people would run over me. When you think of your capacity, you start in the back. When you forget about your capacity, you go forward.

People who encourage the runners in the Boston Marathon are much more divine than people who encourage runners in many other races. How they cheered us on!

Even before I covered the first mile, I was totally exhausted. You can call it tiredness or hunger or thirst -- God knows. After seven miles a little boy stood right in front of me and gave me a glass of water, literally forcing me to drink it.

I said, "How old are you?"

He said, "Four."

So many runners patted me on the back, saying, "Come along, friend, you can make it. Don't give up. Go on, go on, go on!" They were going ahead of me and encouraging me as they passed by. They were very nice people.

One thin girl who had run in our twenty-four-hour race was running the marathon. She is very thin, like Kusumita. Her name is Kim. She had been behind me, but around the ten-mile point she passed me. As she went by she shouted, "Hello, Guru. I am happy to see you." While she was saying this, she was taking off her long-sleeved shirt. It was like our purple shirt. It had my picture on the back and said "Sri Chinmoy Marathon." Underneath she was wearing a short-sleeved T-shirt. I thought she would throw the long-sleeved shirt on the street, but she held it as she ran.

I saw two or three more non-disciples wearing different shirts of ours. But Kim was the only one who recognised me.

The children watching the Boston Marathon were so nice. Little, little children were offering us ice. The people who were spraying us with hoses were my best friends. But some runners didn't like it; they got annoyed. Some runners were for water and some were not. I was for water.

An elderly black man and I were running together, and two or three times people got so much joy from drenching us. We were two runners who were getting new life from the hoses. But other runners were cursing them. They had to go to the other side of the street to avoid the hoses.

In today's eight-hundred-metre Green Leaves and Ripe Fruits race for men and women over fifty, Vince and I were going slowly and only keeping pace with Ilona during the first four hundred metres. But we knew that we would end up going ahead of her. After four hundred metres we started widening the gap, and Ilona fell behind us by a big margin. Whenever I increased my speed, Vince would increase his speed. In the last hundred metres we had a wonderful fight. I won by only one second.

I was planning to walk the whole race, but then Vince would have had no other competitor, except for a few ladies. His fate would have been like Senani's in the sixty-and-over race.

Nayana and Dhrubha have exactly the same style, but Nayana twists her face and smiles while she runs. Dhrubha never smiles.

Then I saw Sanatan. For thirty or forty metres I was smiling at him, but he was blind; he could not see me. Then, when he came near me, he folded his hands.

Then I saw Sudhir on the other side of the street. Only when I started shouting his name did he recognise me. Then I saw Shephali. By that time I was dying.

Today as soon as I started running, I saw Gitika, and then on the other side of the street I saw Pidgeon. Then I saw Bob Barrett. I said to myself, "Since Bob is there, perhaps his wife is running behind him." I was right. O God, she was so far behind! Then I greeted her. As Bob was coming back to where I was, he shouted, "O Guru, it is so nice to see you!"

Then, after about two miles, somebody right behind me said, "Very good pace, very good pace!

I said to myself, "A joker!" and looked around. Whom did I see? It was the young black man who had stood third in our race on Sunday. He said, "You put on a very good race, and I enjoyed it very much." So I smiled at him. After two minutes he was still running ahead of me. Then, after three minutes, he was nowhere to be seen.

After about three miles I saw Karabi. As I continued running, I saw the young man returning. When he saw me, he raised his arms over his head, greeting me.

Today Databir and I were buying running shoes. The young man who was selling the shoes was saying that all the shoes were very good, just because he wanted to sell them. When he brought out one particular shoe, he said that he had used this one to run a 4:46 mile. Then he said he had run 800 metres in 1:30. His best time of all was in the quarter-mile, he said. He was bragging that he had done a quarter-mile in 55 seconds -- not only once, but twice.

I couldn't help laughing. I said, "I am an Indian. I did it in 54 and 53.6. Under 54 I did it many times before you were born."

Then he said, "I am so honoured that you have come."

Then Databir told him that I had done it without shoes, on a cinder track.

The first time, in 1945, I did the quarter-mile in one minute. Then in 1946 from one minute it came down to 56 seconds, then 55 and then always under 55-54, 53.9 and so on.

Seven miles a day I ran for five days. Is it a joke? And Union Turnpike has hills!

I have maintained my weight at 138 pounds for so many days! Today I have come down to 136. I have a chart of good runners. Out of twelve runners, only one runner is fat. Eleven are thin.

Before the start of the Long Island Marathon, an old bald-headed man came up to me. He didn't fold his hands, but he was full of reverential awe. He said, "Are you Sri Chinmoy?"

I said I was.

He said, "I am so happy and honoured to be here and speak to you. This is my first marathon."

So I congratulated him. He said, "I have run quite a few races of yours."

Then the funniest thing happened. After fourteen miles, I got the shock of my life. He was passing me coming from the other direction. I asked myself, "How could he be so far ahead of me if this is his first marathon?"

I waved to him. I usually don't wave to anybody, but he had been so nice to me. Later I realised that I was actually ahead of him. He finished far behind me.

Last night a little after twelve-thirty I went running. After five and a half miles or so, when I was on my way back, I saw a car that was making absolutely unthinkable, unbearable noises. Luckily, I was on the other side of the street, so I was quite safe. Then that same car went ahead, made a U-turn and came to my side. It was still making such noise! So I jumped onto the sidewalk, and continued running quite peacefully.

Suddenly the car stopped right alongside of me. It was a red car with a black hood. Two young girls were inside. One of them said, "Excuse me, excuse me, are you Sri Chinmoy? Are you Sri Chinmoy?"

I said, "Yes."

She said, "We are so happy to see you. We saw you on television two days ago." They were so excited to see me at that hour. So I thanked them.

They were very, very nice girls, but what were they doing in that car at that hour?

Outside the bar I saw eight or ten undivine people. I said, "O God, let me go another way." So I had to retrace my steps and take another street in order to avoid them.

Then I was near Divine Robe Supreme. I wanted to go to the playground, so I took a side street, again only to meet four or five undivine people -- near Chidananda's house. They were very bad people. So I went back and started running on another road. After I got to the track there was no problem. Then I ran alone on the beautiful track.

While coming back near Annam Brahma, I saw somebody trying to start his motorbike. The noise was unbearable. His girlfriend didn't want to go with him on the motorbike. With one hand he was holding the bike and with the other hand he was holding her.

Karabi is wonderful. Yesterday she saw me while I was running, but I didn't see her. She was in her car, coming back from the Queens College track. She gave a full description of what I was wearing.

After running five miles I was returning, near Main Street. According to my standard, I was going fast. But a middle-aged lady said to her friend, "His nose is running faster than his legs!"

It was true that my nose was running.

So the other lady said, "Yes, you go and join him and try to run."

Inwardly I thanked the second lady.

In the morning what kind of appreciation I get! These people's souls want to talk to me.

Yasu saw me, then Kalatit and then Edythe. She was in a car, driving to Flushing Meadow to set up. But once I got home I pretended that I had not yet run so I could surprise everyone later.

During the race I was afraid Yasu would say, "I saw you running this morning," but fortunately he didn't say anything, so I kept my secret.

I was running so slowly during the ten-mile race that I didn't feel tired at all, even after nine miles. Then I waved to Lavanya and Chetana, saying that I was going to go faster for the last mile.

So this morning altogether I ran seventeen miles.

There were many people who were breathing louder than I was. In the Athens Marathon that I ran a few years ago, there was one person breathing so heavily that you could hear him a hundred meters away.

Before the marathon that year, a Chinese doctor had given a talk about how he had cured so many patients who had come to him. In spite of my cramps this doctor was two or three miles behind me.

While I was running, six or seven people recognised me. Two or three stopped and shook hands with me.

Just before the twelve-mile point, there was an Indian ahead of me. He turned around and shouted, "Are you an Indian?"

I said, "Yes."

Then the man he was running with, an American, said, "He is the big boss."

That Indian lives only three houses away from X. She knows him.

While running the marathon, Chetana and Chandika were talking and smiling the whole time. They were not only running a marathon, they were enjoying a marathon talk.

* Thanking God

I thank God from the bottom of my heart when I see some people's strides. During the California race I was watching the strides of an old man. I said, "God, I should thank You for one thing: that I don't have that kind of stride."

There was one old man whose style I will never forget. His right leg had one kind of position, his left leg another, and his shoulder had a completely different position. O God, how did he run? His entire body was twisted in three different places.

This morning around six-thirty I was walking down the 150th Street hill after running seven miles. At the bottom of the hill there was a big bus stopped at a red light. Behind the bus was a car with two very tall and stout black men in it. The driver had a beard and moustache. When I was about to go back up the hill, the driver got out of the car and took two steps towards me. "How nice to see you this morning!" he said.

I didn't know what to say. So I smiled at him soulfully. Then he went back into his car.

Yesterday at about five-fifteen in the morning I was running near my two-and-a-half-mile point on Union Turnpike. A young man was talking on the phone in a telephone booth as I passed by. All of a sudden he started screaming, "Look, look! Sri Chinmoy is running!" He was so excited. He was telling the person he was talking to on the phone that he was seeing me run by.

I stopped and gave the young man a smile. He was in the seventh heaven of delight. He was tall and clean-shaven, with curly hair, and he had a pack on his back.

These people who greet me in the morning are in some ways my first-class disciples. They get up early in the morning, and they are so happy to see me.

The other day when I was running up the 150th Street Hill, a lady on the street caught me. She stopped me and asked, "Can I speak to you?"

I called Databir and he came running. I told him, "Please talk to her." So Databir talked to her. Later, he said she was crazy. But she didn't seem to me to be crazy. Perhaps she also thought that Databir was crazy.
