In supreme Silence
The Absolute Lord Supreme
Says to the God-Realised souls,
“My supremely chosen children,
I bring you into the world
Not to defend yourselves
Under any circumstances,
But to love Me and serve Me
Unconditionally, sleeplessly
And breathlessly
In My own Way
In each human being
And also in each earth-planet-creation
Of Mine.
You must realise that as you claim Me
To be your All,
Even so, I claim you,
My Oneness-Vision-Reality-children,
To be My All.”

My Lord,
I wish to know from You personally
The differences that exist
Between You and me.

“My child,
There are countless differences
But I shall name only three:
Unlike Me, every day
You have a very tight schedule.
You have no time to write to Me.
You have no time to speak to Me.
You do not even have the time
To speak to me over your heart-phone.
I write to you every day.
I try to speak to you every day.
But alas, alas and alas,
I get no response from you.
Now the second difference is this:
I constantly make fun of myself.
Alas, you have not yet learnt
This particular art,
And I have no idea whether
You will ever be able to learn this art.
The third difference is this:
You think and you feel
That you are indispensable
There in Heaven and here on earth.
In My case, I am absolutely sure
That not only this world,
But also all the worlds
That are in existence,
Can live without Me.
In a sense, you are badly needed
Here, there and all-where.
In My case, nobody wants Me,
Nobody needs Me.
I am left all alone.”

Run, run, run!
Spirituality needs both
The inner running
And the outer running.
Neither the inner running
Nor the outer running
Is a curiosity-invitation.
In the life of a genuine God-seeker
And God-lover,
Curiosity-indulgence is an inescapable
And inevitable self-destructive force.
Only when God’s unconditional
Forgiveness-Power descends,
Can the seeker make a fresh attempt
At spiritual progress.
Before we accept spirituality,
Curiosity may inspire a certain seeker
To enter into the spiritual life.
But once a seeker is spiritually
Well-established,
Curiosity-indulgence
Is the most self-destructive force.

/These prayers were mostly offered by Sri Chinmoy at the conclusion of the weekly Saturday morning “Runners are smilers two-mile races” held in New York. In 2002 Sri Chinmoy renamed them “Self-Transcendence Races.” During Christmas trips to other countries, additional races are held on other days of the week over shorter or longer distances. Sri Chinmoy frequently participated in these races./
