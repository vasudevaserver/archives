Gratitude is the youngest
And strongest
Of all our divine qualities.

Your earthly hours
Cannot be more important
Than God´s Heavenly Hours.
If God has the time
To meditate on you,
Then can you not also
At least take the time
To pray to Him?

* The significance of a child

  :PROPERTIES:
  :GENRE: discourse
  :cite-key: NGO:101
  :END:


It is a child, not an old person, who makes progress in life. Old people do not care for progress. But mere years do not make a person old. Somebody who is sixty or seventy years of age may have the enthusiasm, inner joy and inspiration of a child. Again, there will be people seventeen, eighteen or nineteen years old who have no aspiration, no inspiration, no dynamism. If a boy of nineteen does not have the capacity to draw something from the world or to offer something to the world, if he does not care for the world and feels that he does not need anything from the world, then he is ninety-nine years old in spirit. On the other hand, if somebody of ninety-nine wants to learn the inner language –- the language of divine love, the language of divine peace, the language of divine wisdom, the language of divine light –- then he is a child in spirit. In the spiritual life we are not concerned with earthly years but with an individual´s inner eagerness to do something and to become something -– to become a child of God.

If you really want to become a child, then you have to feel that there is always something to learn and that God is there to teach you. In the spiritual life you are learning something every day, every hour, every minute, every second from our divine Father. If you constantly have the feeling that you are learning in the inner world, there is no end to the God-divinity that you can receive and achieve.



* A childlike heart

  :PROPERTIES:
  :GENRE: discourse

Because a child lives in the heart, he always feels that his mother or his father will take care of him. All the time he feels that there is protection, there is guidance, there is assistance. So naturally he has confidence in his life. Because he is always in the heart, he feels that there is no need which his parents will not fulfil. If he lived in the mind, he would immediately think, “Oh, perhaps my father will not be able to do this. Perhaps my mother will not be there to help me.“ Then he would become fearful, doubtful and anxious. But a child does not live in the mind. Similarly, if you want to have a childlike spirit, no matter how old you are, you have to feel that there is Someone with infinitely more Wisdom-Light who is constantly thinking of you, and that this Person is God.

He who cares more for the intellect than for the heart, he who cares more for the outer achievement than for the inner achievement, he who cares more for society around him than for God within him, can never act like a child. A true child lives all the time in the heart, whereas a grown-up is all the time in the mind.

In the mind there is no love. Real love can be found only inside the flower-heart. The flower-heart tries all the time to make others happy. Because God has the flower-heart of a child, He is trying all the time to make us happy.
A child´s flower heart is a divine heart. If we remain in the outer world, we see children as ordinary human beings. But if we go within, then we immediately see that children embody all the divine qualities of God. At that time we see children as true miracles –- as divine instruments, as flowers of God.
