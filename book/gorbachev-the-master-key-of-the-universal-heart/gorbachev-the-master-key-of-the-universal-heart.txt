"I don't think much of a man who is not wiser today than he was yesterday."

-Abraham Lincoln

Similarly, the perfection-lover in the wise President Gorbachev says: "Well, suppose we made mistakes. So what? It is better to rectify them than sit and wait."

"Am I not destroying my enemies when I make friends of them?"

-Abraham Lincoln

President Gorbachev illumines his adversaries instead of destroying them. In this inimitable way, he and his friends, both new and old, walk, march and run towards the same destination: a oneness-peace-world.

Two Mahatmas: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi of India and Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev of Russia.

India's freedom-champion Mahatma Gandhi teaches, "The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong."

Many world figures over the years have ruthlessly spoken ill of President Gorbachev. With his indomitable mind and his compassionate heart, the supreme Pilot of the Soviet Union has smilingly forgiven them. Slowly and steadily a peaceful life of harmony is blossoming in the heart-garden of Mother-Earth.

The ideal of communism is to work according to your capacity and to receive according to your necessity. Can this theory have any equal? The Vedic seers of the hoary past had this kind of unparalleled vision for world-harmony, world-peace and world-fulfilment.

Theory is one thing, but practice can be completely different. It is the practice that affects human life. Alas, alas, Stalin's practices destroyed the beauty and fragrance of the communism-flower. But President Gorbachev reminds us with his direct and to-the-point statement that the very idea of communism is not something to be feared or hated:

"I am a communist. I'm sure that answer doesn't make you too enthusiastic, but It shouldn't make you panic either. It's quite normal."

Some blame you because you do not want them to remain where they are: inside pitch-dark caves. Others blame you for not wholeheartedly helping them run at their fastest dream-speed.

Those who do not want to budge an inch are fervently requested by you to move forward and bathe in the beauty and purity of tomorrow's dawn. Those who are over-eager but have no capacity to run the fastest along the world-progress-road, are compassionately and powerfully cautioned by you to stop indulging in meaningless fantasies.

Raisa Maximowna Gorbachev, O Sister of the Soviet Union, your momentous utterance runs:

"I am an atheist, but I know the church, and I respect all faiths. It is, after all, a personal matter. I believe in the natural goodness of people, and I firmly believe that no one wants war."

She who respects all faiths is a supreme seeker. To believe in the natural goodness of people is in itself a high attainment. Each human being has to have faith in something. Without faith one cannot exist. Your faith is in the goodness of human beings. For us that very thing is God, for God is all Goodness. Therefore, you do believe in God.

Now President Gorbachev comes to our assistance with a confident step forward, inward and upward to raise the consciousness of humanity. Compellingly, he declares:

"Let each live by his own convictions and worship his own God."

At his first meeting with the author, President Gorbachev warmly tells him, "I have heard so much about you and your work. We must work together for world peace." The meeting took place on 29 May 1990 at the Canadian Governor-General's Residence in Ottawa.

Sri Chinmoy offers his utmost gratitude to President Gorbachev, stating, "You are the master-key of the global heart. You have liberated the world from bondage-night, and you have brought to the fore the inner freedom which we need so desperately. Before, people were in darkness, and now you have brought light to them."

Sri Chinmoy reads the words to the song he has composed for President Gorbachev. Visible on the back of the pamphlet is a photograph of the President with Mrs. Gorbachev, which the President later noticed with great joy. Looking on is President Gorbachev's interpreter.

At the same meeting, Rabindra David Hamilton, a student of Sri Chinmoy, presents President Gorbachev with a book of letters from prominent Canadians expressing their deepest appreciation for the Soviet leader's work for world peace.

29 May 1990

Dear President Gorbachev,

O master-key of the global heart, this evening you bestowed upon me and my two Canadian studentfriends your blessingful affection, compassion and oneness. For that, our hearts are all gratitude to you.

With my soulful gratitude-heart I am offering these songs to you. The first one is written by me, and the subsequent ones are from your own momentous utterances.

Dear President, your heart of compassion and affection I shall most devotedly treasure. Indeed, as I wrote in my song, "Gorbachev, Gorbachev, all-where the peace-blossom-tree." You have brought to the fore the inner freedom of humanity. You have liberated much of the world from bondage-divisionnight. Therefore, both the ascending cries of humanity and the descending smiles of divinity you embody.

May the Soviet Union and Canada, in your oneness-heart, divinely grow and supremely glow.

Yours in the Almighty Father

in Heaven,

Sri Chinmoy

This essay was written by the author and sent to President Gorbachev on 11 June 1990.
Spirituality
Can enter into politics.
Spirituality
Does not dismiss politics.


POLITICS AND SPIRITUALITY

Politics can claim spirituality.
Likewise,
Spirituality can claim polities.
Politics and spirituality
Are branches of the same life-tree,
And this life-tree
Is all oneness-peace.


Spirituality is the heart.
Politics is the body.
These two are at once
Interdependent
And indispensable to each other.


The body is the flower.
The heart is the fragrance.
The flower charmingly reminds us
Of our universal beauty.
The fragrance breathlessly reminds us
Of our transcendental divinity.


Gorbachev the flower
Our outer world unsurpassably loves.
Gorbachev the fragrance
Our inner world unreservedly treasures.

Many are the well-wishers of the Soviet Union. Some are sincere, while others are not. But the Holy Father, whose heart is pure sincerity and whose life is blessingful concern, offers these words of encouragement and appreciation to President Gorbachev:

"The Holy See follows with great interest the process of renewal which you have set in motion in the Soviet Union. It wishes you success and declares itself ready to support every initiative that will better protect and integrate the rights and duties of individuals and peoples, so that peace may be insured in Europe and the world."

President Gorbachev, the universal oneness-lightseeker and the universal oneness-might-inspirer, responds:

"People of many faiths, including Christians, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists and others, live in the Soviet Union. All of them have a right to satisfy their spiritual needs."

Together we shall sail.
Together we shall weather the storm.
Together we shall reach
The Golden Shore of the Beyond.

In his turn, President Gorbachev spoke about the U.N. with glowing admiration. Unfortunately, not many have highly appreciated the United Nations. But President Gorbachev said about the U.N. and its Secretary-General, "God is on your side at the United Nations."

These few precious words will forever shine in the heart-history of the United Nations. Only a supreme seeker can feel the necessity of spirituality and God at the United Nations. From his aspiration-heart and dedication-life, President Gorbachev reveals to the entire world what the United Nations actually stands for in the annals of history.
