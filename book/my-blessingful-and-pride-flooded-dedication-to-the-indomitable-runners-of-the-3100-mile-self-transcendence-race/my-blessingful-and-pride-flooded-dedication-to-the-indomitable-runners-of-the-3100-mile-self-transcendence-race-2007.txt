During the summer of 2007, the annual Sri Chinmoy 3,100-mile Self-Transcendence Race took place in Jamaica, Queens. The twelve runners participating in this event, which is the longest footrace in the world, circled a city block whose circumference is just over a half mile. Sri Chinmoy visited the race several times every day to offer the runners his encouragement, support, concern and love. From June 18th until the last runner finished on August 14th, he also offered them a daily prayer. These beautiful and deeply meaningful prayers were distributed to each runner and also posted on the bulletin board at the counting station. The runners and helpers all derived boundless inspiration from Sri Chinmoy's morning prayers. The 58 prayers are reproduced in this book in Sri Chinmoy's original hand-writing.
