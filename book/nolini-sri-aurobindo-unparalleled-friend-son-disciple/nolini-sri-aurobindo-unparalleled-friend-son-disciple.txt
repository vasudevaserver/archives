To Sri Manoj Das Gupta

Lovingly and gratefully I dedicate my /Nolini: Sri Aurobindo's Unparalleled Friend-Son-Disciple/  to Manoj, whom Nolini-da himself chose to be his blessingful and soulful successor. May Sri Aurobindo and the Mother sempiternally continue to shower their fond affection and choice blessings upon the beautiful aspiration-heart and powerful dedication-life of Manoj.
