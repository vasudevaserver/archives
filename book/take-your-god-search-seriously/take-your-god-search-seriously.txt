Plays illumination-flute.

O seeker, do you not realise
What you are doing?
Every day, just because
You pray and meditate,
You feel that you have the right
To make extravagant demands
Upon God.

Hurry and worry.

God does not mind
If you do not understand Him
When He speaks to you.
You can be sure
He is not going to make
His point clearer
Just because you want Him
To make you understand
What He is saying.
His Vision-Light is not
Something to understand
But something to love and love
And eventually grow into.
