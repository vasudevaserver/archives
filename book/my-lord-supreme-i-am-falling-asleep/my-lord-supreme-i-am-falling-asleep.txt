My Lord Supreme,
What is the difference between
Greatness and goodness?
My child, Greatness means "I am."
Goodness means "Thou art."

My Lord Supreme,
What do I need?
Excellence or transcendence?
My child,
You need both.
The human in you needs Excellence,
The divine in you needs Transcendence.

My Lord Supreme,
How can my mind, my heart
And my life be truly happy'?
My child,
Your mind can be truly happy
Only by renouncing
Its possession-greed,
Your heart, by multiplying
Its God-hunger
And your life, by enjoying
Its God-surrender-feast.

My Lord Supreme,
In Your kind opinion, who am I today
And what shall I be tomorrow?
My child,
In My opinion, you are today
Your fantasy-dream
And tomorrow you will be
Your ecstasy-reality.

My Lord Supreme,
I beg of You,
Do tell me what is within me
And what is without me.
My child,
Within you are
Your heart's soft whispers,
And without you are
Your mind's loud murmurs.

My Lord Supreme,
May I know what You are going to do
With my desire-mind
And my aspiration-heart?
My child,
With your desire-mind,
I have decided to dig My own grave
And with your aspiration-heart
I have decided to create a new paradise.

With my desire-face
And with my aspiration-eyes?

Your desire-face
And I have decided to affectionately
Treasure your aspiration-eyes.

My Lord Supreme,
What are You going to do
With my desire-mind
And my satisfaction-heart?
My child, I have decided
To carry your desire-mind
And sink both of us together
In ignorance-sea.
I have decided to carry
Your satisfaction-heart
Inside my Golden Boat
And sail together
To the Shores
Of the ever-transcending Beyond.

My Lord Supreme,
What do You do
When I demand something from You
And expect something from You
And really need something from You?
My child,
When you demand, I immediately fall asleep
And start snoring.
When you expect, I quickly wake up
And start singing.
When you need, I sprint toward you
Like your Sudhahota Carl Lewis,
The world's fastest sprinter,
And smilingly reach you
And affectionately give you what you need.

With my complicated mind?
My child, I shall very carefully
Take your complicated mind
To My new school
That will teach your mind how to unlearn.

Take your simplicity-heart

That will teach your heart
How to acquire wisdom-light
More, infinitely more.

My Lord Supreme,
When I isolate my mind from others,
Does it affect You?
My child,
It does.
It definitely does.
Something within Me
Compels Me to cry most pitifully.

Do I have anything to make you happy?

Your heart's faith-founded existence-life
Makes Me happy, boundlessly happy,
Far beyond your imagination.

My Lord Supreme,
I feel so sorry for You.
I really do.
My child,
Why do you feel sorry for Me?
I am so clever that I can easily convince You
That I love You, but You find it so difficult
To convince me that You love me,
Therefore, I feel sorry for You.
My child,
I am so grateful to you that you have such
Genuine sympathy for Me.
Where can I find
Another sympathetic heart like yours?

My Lord Supreme,
When I devotedly pray
and soulfully meditate,
I can clearly see that my life is
an open book to You.
But alas, no matter how hard I try
to know about
Your earthly life and Heavenly life,
I sadly fail.
Therefore I am begging You to be kind to me
And share some of Your secrets.
My child,
I shall comply with your request
But I do not know whether My secrets
Will make you happy or unhappy.
Anyway, I leave it up to you.
My secret number one:
Each time your desiring mind
Defeats your aspiring heart,
I cry and cry.
My secret number two:
When you dine with your mind-doubts
And starve your heart-faith,
I cry and cry.
My secret number three:
Each time you do not allow your heart
To fulfil its Heaven-climbing promises,
I cry and cry.
My secret number four:
Each time you do not allow your soul to fulfil
Its Heaven-manifesting promises on earth,
I cry and cry.
My secret number five:
When your life-boat plies
Between your depression-vital-shore
And your frustration-mind-shore,
I cry and cry.
My secret number six:
When you become the most intimate friend
Of your body's idleness
and your mind's unwillingness,
I cry and cry.
My Lord Supreme,
I don't know why I suddenly feel so tired
and sleepy.
It seems that You have literally
endless secrets.
Yes, my child. I do.
Then,
My Lord, some other day
I shall definitely hear more of Your secrets.
My child, My child, wait, wait.
Only one more secret I wish to share
with you
Before you fall asleep.
This time, I am blessing you
with My topmost secret:
You are My Today's Self-Transcendence-Dream
And My Tomorrow's Self-Perfection-Satisfaction-Reality.
My Lord Supreme,
I am fast asleep.
I cannot hear You anymore.
My child, I am still fully awake.
I shall do everything for you.
You enjoy your sweet sleep.
