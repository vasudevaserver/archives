  This book consists of a series of brief, revealing glimpses of God the Supreme Father by a spiritual Master who has experienced them first-hand. Many of these revelations take the form of conversations between Sri Chinmoy, the son, and his all-loving, all-illumining Father.The son knows his Father will answer all his questions, from the most profound to the utterly insignificant. Indeed, the Father is never too busy to speak with His child; His only desire is to see him happy and fulfilled.
  
  The conversations convey the loving intimacy between God and man. They also express, on another level, the parallel relationship that unites the realised spiritual Master with his disciple-children. The secrets revealed in this book stand as the supreme realisations of an illumined soul.
