WE BELIEVE and we hold that each man has the potentiality of reaching the Ultimate Truth. We also believe that man cannot and will not remain imperfect forever. Each man is an instrument of God. When the hour strikes, each individual soul listens to the inner dictates of God. When man listens to God, his imperfections are turned into perfections, his ignorance into knowledge, his searching mind into revealing light and his uncertain reality into all-fulfilling Divinity.

The seeker in me says, “I wish to see God.” But do I not know that God is continually looking at me?

The seeker in me says, “I wish to love God.” But do I not know that God is continually loving me?

The seeker in me says, “I wish to give God my life’s best achievement: surrender.” But do I not know that God has already given me His Eternity’s best achievement: oneness?

Seeing is a two-way experience. Loving is a two-way realisation. Giving is a two-way perfection.

Experience makes us infinite. Realisation makes us eternal. Perfection makes us immortal.

Infinite is dream. Eternal is reality. Immortal is progress.

Dream is God the cosmic Seed. Reality is God the cosmic Fruit. Progress is God the universal and transcendental Tree.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

O my heart’s possibility-seed,
In you I see my mind’s hopeful plant,
My life’s soulful flower and
My soul’s fruitful food.

O my heart’s possibility-seed,
You embody my promise-dawn,
You reveal my success-sun,
You manifest my progress-light.

O my heart’s possibility-seed,
This moment you are my caterpillar-dream,
The next moment you are my butterfly-reality.
This moment you are my rainbow-beauty,
The next moment you are my satisfaction-prosperity.

O my heart’s possibility-seed,
In God’s entire creation
I have only one possession
And that is you, only you.

O my heart’s possibility-seed,
With you, my journey’s Eternity;
In you, my goal’s Infinity.

O my heart’s possibility-seed,
You gave me my inspiration-capacity,
You are giving me my aspiration-Divinity,
And you will give me my realisation-Immortality.

O my heart’s possibility-seed,
You are at once unveiling the universal art
  of my life’s mystery
And granting me the transcendental picture
  of my soul’s victory.

  Sorrow, my sorrow, my world-sorrow,
You have given me a pure heart.
  Sorrow, my sorrow, my world-sorrow,
You have granted me a wise mind.
  Sorrow, my sorrow, my world-sorrow,
You have given me a brave vital and a
    sleepless body.
  Sorrow, my sorrow, my world-sorrow,
You have given me two most precious gifts:
    Patience-seed and perseverance-fruit.
  Sorrow, my sorrow, my world-sorrow,
You warn me timely, you correct me soulfully
    And you perfect me unreservedly.
  Sorrow, my sorrow, my world-sorrow,
You have taught me how to walk along
    the road of Truth.
You have taught me the secret of self-giving.
You have given me universal Love
So that I can become the Transcendental Soul.
  Sorrow, my sorrow, my world-sorrow,
It is from your infinite bounty
That I have developed an eternal hunger to devour
The infinite Light and Delight of my
    Beloved Supreme.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

I hear a still small voice in the depth of my heart.
It tells me that now is the only time for me
To become great in the outer world,
And that now is the only time for me
To become good in the inner world.
My greatness is from God the omnipotent Creator.
My goodness is from God the omnipresent Liberator.

Now is the only time to do God’s Will.
What is God’s Will?
God’s Will is that I should never try to earn
      anything from God.
I cannot earn anything from God.
Indeed, that is an impossible task.
Indeed, that is an absurd notion.
I can only cheerfully accept from God
What God unconditionally gives me.
Needless to say, God grants me at every moment
What He has and what He is.
But alas, where is my receptivity?
I know God has a special Will for me.
He always wants to take the initiative.
He wants me to follow Him.
He tells me that I am not going to lose my personal
        freedom.
On the contrary, I shall increase my freedom,
For His Freedom-Vision is carrying me to my
       destination
Which is flooded with Perfection-Delight.
In this connection, I have also discovered
       something very important.
There is a great difference between these two
       realisations:
I am one with God’s Will and God is one with
       my will.
I am one with God’s Will. What does it mean?
It means that I am swimming in the ocean of
       God’s Wisdom-Delight.
God is one with my will. What does it mean?
It means that God is more than willing to be
       with me in my ignorance-night
With His infinite Compassion-Light.
To know God’s Will, surrender is the real way.
Indeed, that is the road for me.
I can weather all the storms of my inner life
       and outer life
When my existence becomes unmistakably and
       unreservedly
A surrendered flower-heart.
God tells me. “True, you do not know Me,
       but your surrender-life knows.
True, you do not love Me,
       but your gratitude-heart loves.
Your surrender-life is my cosmic Vision-Seed.
Your gratitude-heart is my cosmic Reality-Fruit.

How do I know

How do I know
That God will stay with me tomorrow
In spite of my staggering impurity?

Such being the case,
I shall have to depend only on today.
Even today is too much.
Stark temptation and wild frustration
May kill me if I wait for God-realisation
Until the end of the day.

To be sure, there is no tomorrow, not even a today.
All I have is now.
All I can ever have is now.

With now, my preparation begins.
In now, my realisation dawns.
For now, my perfection glows.

I am happy because I always choose the right moment.

I am happy because I am a good listener.

I am happy because I keep my voice down.

I am happy because I do not try to convince others.

I am happy because I do not complain.

I am happy because I do not do two things at the same time.

I am happy because I never think of two objects at the same time.

I am happy because I have realised the truth that the most important thing in my life is self-improvement.

I am happy because I unreservedly accentuate the good in others.

I am happy because I have considerably cut down on my desiring needs.

I am happy because I follow my thought-control programme every day.

I am happy because I never quit.

I am happy because every day I purify my heart by offering my heart of gratitude to the Absolute Supreme.

I am happy because I know that my love of purity works wonders.

I am happy because of a soulful daily prayer of mine, and that prayer is:


#+BEGIN_VERSE

O Beloved Supreme,
O Eternity’s Pilot Supreme,
Do transform the world
Starting with me, my life, my all.

#+END_VERSE


I am happy because every day I cry and cry to see the Real in me. The Real in me is my oneness divine, unreserved and unconditional, with the Will of my Beloved Supreme.

I am happy not because I am for my Supreme Pilot, not because my Supreme Pilot is for me, but because my Supreme Pilot eternally is. His very existence here on earth, there in Heaven, is my satisfaction. When I try to have Him for myself, I pull Him into my desire-life. But when I am for Him, I carry my desire-life into Him. In no way do I want to bind my Beloved Supreme. From now on my satisfaction, my supreme satisfaction, will lie only in my discovery of the fact that He alone eternally is.

  :PROPERTIES:

  :END:


Simplicity, you have been for long years my soulful guide. It has always been my valued privilege to work with you.

Simplicity, you tell me that I do not need any mental equipment. I do not need a degree of erudition. What I need, according to you, is a vast wealth of experience. Although this wealth is /of/ the inner world, it is unreservedly /for/ the outer world.

The world of crying aspiration needs you. The world of smiling dedication needs you. The world of prayerful humanity needs you. The world of meditative divinity needs you.

Simplicity, you have been serving God the Creator in God the creation through the long millennia.

Simplicity, alert you are, dynamic you are. In you there is always an inner urge for new and illumining realisations. In your heart there is no place for the static, stagnant, barren and dead realities. Your heart is unreservedly involved in determining man’s soulful success and fruitful progress.

Simplicity, you are great. You do not house mental narrowness, vital laziness or intellectual indifference. Simplicity, you are good. Your very existence on earth grants the Truth-seeker, the God-lover, the rare capacity to combine in his life beauty with power, duty with delight and expectation with satisfaction.





* Courage versus humility[fn:: UNMF 21. 19 April 1977]

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: UNMF:21
  :END:


Courage challenges the world. Humility illumines the world. Courage strongly urges us to stand up for our own rights. Humility soulfully inspires us to stand up for God’s rights alone.

Courage is not aggression. Aggression is man’s destruction-force. Humility is not humiliation. Humiliation is man’s rejection-force. Courage is man’s self-determination. Humility is man’s oneness-distribution. Self-determination eventually succeeds. Oneness-distribution constantly proceeds.

Courage is man’s conquering force. Humility is man’s unifying force. Courage feeds the divine human in us. Humility feeds the unifying and immortal divine in us.

The seeker in us uses courage to conquer the teeming doubts in the mental world. The seeker in us uses humility to constantly gain faith, to increase faith in God’s universal Oneness and Light.

Courage is the struggle, birthless and deathless, between man’s victory and defeat, between man’s joy and sorrow, between man’s smiles and tears, between man’s acceptance and rejection, between what man has and what man is. What man has is sound-satisfaction and what man is is silence-perfection.

Humility is man’s divine and supreme Glory-bird that flies from God’s Infinity-Dawn to God’s Eternity-Day and from God’s Eternity-Day to God’s Infinity-Dawn.

With courage we manifest God in our own way. With humility, God manifests Himself in and through us in His own way.

Let us keep going. We must not give up. Although the dragon-thoughts of frustration assail us, we must not give up! There is definitely a goal, and this goal must needs be ours. We must not give up!

Although Heaven does not feed our heart’s cry regularly, although earth does not entirely support our spiritual journey, still we must not give up!

Let us invoke the presence of our indomitable courage-fount to help us conquer the feelings of loneliness and unworthiness. We must not give up!

Although the world does not appreciate us, although the world does not see the beauty and the light in us, we must not give up appreciating the world. Indeed, this world of ours is also an instrument of God. Like us, it considers God-realisation, God-revelation and God-manifestation as its bounden duty. Therefore, we must appreciate the world. After all, what is appreciation? Appreciation is self-expansion. Self-expansion is oneness-awareness, and oneness-awareness is truth-distribution. We must not give up!

Although we do not have a sunny present, although we had a foggy past, although we suspect inclement weather in the near future, we must not give up!

With our mind’s resolution, our heart’s determination and our soul’s illumination, we shall eventually succeed in life. Success is our choice. Progress is God’s choice. Man chooses to become. He becomes confidence-lion within and confidence-elephant without. God chooses to give. He gives us His universal Light constantly, unreservedly and unconditionally. He gives us His transcendental Delight constantly, unreservedly and unconditionally.

We must not give up! Let us prepare ourselves for God’s choice Hour. We must not give up!

What is my duty? I have stopped dining with ignorance-sea. I have stabbed darkness-night. I have given a smart slap to frustration-giant. I have boxed the ears of anxiety-twinges. I have broken the nose of jealousy-impurity. I have kicked off my insecurity-world.

What is my next duty? I have literally taken the life-breath out of pride-autocracy. I have soulfully embraced humility-light.

What is my next duty? I have unlearned everything that I have learned from this insufficiency-world.

What is my next duty? Simplicity’s life I have become. Sincerity’s heart I have become. Purity’s soul I have become.

What is my next duty? I have seen God face to face. I have loved God’s Earth-Body and God’s Heaven-Soul all at once.

What is my next duty? My vision has inseparably become one with God the Silence in Heaven. My mission has inseparably become one with God the Sound on earth.

What is my next duty? My next duty, my only duty, is to beg the present God the Creator to transform Himself into a new Creator. I shall then urge the new Creator to create a new world which will be known as Infinity’s Satisfaction-Delight, founded upon Immortality’s Perfection-Light.

On our birthday the Absolute Supreme reminds our soul about the promise that it has made to Him. On our birthday the soul reminds the body, the physical consciousness, about the promise that the physical has made to it.

The soul’s promise to the Absolute Supreme is God-manifestation through conscious and constant cooperation with the body-consciousness. The body’s promise to the soul is cooperation and unreserved and unconditional manifestation of the Supreme. When these two promises are fulfilled, the human being becomes a perfect instrument and perfect representative both of Heaven and of earth.

/[To seekers below thirty years of age]/ Today we shall do a special type of meditation. We shall focus our attention on various places. When we concentrate on the top of our head, we shall imagine a conch. And when we focus our concentration inside the mind, inside the head, we shall imagine a beautiful rose. Then, when our concentration is inside the heart, we shall imagine a beautiful lotus. And when it is around the navel area or below the navel area, we shall imagine a few jasmine flowers.

A conch signifies divine victory. When we meditate on the top of our head, on the crown centre, then it will help us to blow the conch, to sound the divine victory. Then, when we meditate on the head proper, on the mind, the beauty and fragrance of the rose will help us to illumine our unlit human life. When we meditate inside the heart, the beauty and the fragrance of the lotus will help us identify ourselves with the soul. Then, when we meditate around the navel area, the jasmine flowers will help us purify our impure body-reality.

It will be safe and wise to start with the navel area. So for a few seconds please meditate on the navel area and imagine a jasmine flower and establish purity. The jasmine signifies purity. Then come to the heart centre and there imagine a lotus. Imagine a lotus and identify yourself with the soul. When you come to the head, kindly imagine a rose and then illumine your unlit human life. Then come to the top of the head and imagine a conch, the divine victory. Imagine that it is announcing the divine victory, your victory.

/[To seekers over thirty years of age]/ Now let us do a different type of meditation. We shall focus our concentration first on the heart, then on the third eye, and then on the head. While concentrating inside the heart we shall imagine a boat, a golden boat. While concentrating on the third eye we shall imagine the sky. And while concentrating on the top of the head, on the crown centre we shall imagine the sun. The boat is your own Eternity’s boat, the sky is your own Infinity’s self-expansion and the sun is your own Immortality’s new creation.

So let us start with the boat. We shall imagine the boat inside the heart. This boat will be our Eternity’s boat, our own Eternity’s boat which is sailing inside us. And then, when we meditate on the third eye, we shall imagine the sky and our own Infinity. Our own Infinity’s expansion we shall observe. Then we shall meditate on the crown centre and imagine the sun, which is our own Immortality’s new creation.

Expectation is frustration, especially when I want to possess the world. Expectation is frustration, especially when I want to lord it over the world. Expectation is frustration, especially when I want the world to surrender to my will.

Expectation has its justification when I love the world and want the world to offer me a gratitude-heart. Expectation has its justification when I pray to God for the betterment, for the transformation, for the illumination of the world and want the world to offer me a gratitude-heart. Expectation has its justification when I sincerely, devotedly and unreservedly try to elevate the earth-consciousness according to my capacity and want the world to offer me a gratitude-heart.

Expectation is nothing short of satisfaction when I wait devotedly, soulfully and unconditionally for God’s choice Hour to arrive to liberate, illumine, transform, perfect and fulfil me. Expectation is satisfaction when I feel in the inmost recesses of my heart that God is not only my sovereign Lord, the Absolute Supreme, but also my Friend, my eternal Friend and only Friend. Expectation is satisfaction, especially when I know that God has done everything for me in the inner world. This discovery of mine is founded on my faith, my inner faith in Him, not because He has done everything for me, not because He is all Love for me, but because I have realised something else that is infinitely more significant than all this. My realisation is this: my God, my Lord Supreme, my eternal Friend, is everything in and through me. He is expanding and enlarging His own cosmic Vision in and through me. When I realise my expectation of what He has done for me and what He is to me, my life has its soulful purpose and fruitful delight.

When I use the human in me to serve any purpose, my expectation becomes frustration. When I use the divine in me to serve any purpose, my expectation has its justification. At that time expectation itself is justification. But when I use my Lord Supreme, my eternal Friend, to fulfil something, my expectation is satisfaction, for the expectation is the Vision-Light, and the satisfaction is the Reality-Delight. They are one and inseparable.
