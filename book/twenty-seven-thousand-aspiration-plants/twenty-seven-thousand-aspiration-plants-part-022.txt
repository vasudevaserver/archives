His own Satisfaction-Tree,
Which is infinitely taller
Than my desire-life-tree
And my aspiration-life-tree
Put together.

I want my life
To be a twenty-four-hour God-dreamer.

My sweet Lord,
I am sure You know
Perfectly well
That You hurt me deeply
When You say I do not love You
The way I used to love.

My fellow human beings,
You deeply hurt me
When you try to convince me
That I do not care for you
The way I used to care.

In his Eternity's Vision-Boat
To His Infinity's Self-Transcendence-Shore.

I went to God with all my credentials.
God laughed and laughed and laughed.
He said to me,
"Come back in a few years' time
With your new achievements."

I went back to God for the second time,
This time with an empty heart.
As soon as my Lord Supreme
Saw my empty heart,
He became excited and delighted.
He said to me,
"Ah, that is Mine!
Where did you get it?
Who gave it to you?
Your empty heart is absolutely
My own Wealth.
My child, I am so grateful to you
And so proud of you
Because you have returned to Me
My own Possession, My own Wealth,
My own Achievement."
