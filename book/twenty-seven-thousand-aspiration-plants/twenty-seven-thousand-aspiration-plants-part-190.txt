God's Beauty in my body
Fades at God's choice Hour.
God's Beauty in my heart
Remains permanent.
God's Beauty in my soul
At every moment increases
At a very high speed.

The purpose of God's Existence,

If we have implicit faith
In our Lord Supreme,
Then we are bound to see
That this world will have
A new, all-illumining dawn,
Not when we want,
But at His choice Hour.

Who does not have the capacity
To offer the message of peace
To the world at large.

The only Blessing-Boon
I need from You,
My Lord Beloved Supreme,
Is this:
If it is Your Will,
I want to succeed,
And if it is not Your Will,
Then I do not want to succeed.
This is my life of surrender-light
Which I offer to You
At every moment.

Not because I am a poet,
Not because I am a philosopher,

In each and every human being.

Are my heart's brothers and sisters,
And the whole world
Is my oneness-home.
