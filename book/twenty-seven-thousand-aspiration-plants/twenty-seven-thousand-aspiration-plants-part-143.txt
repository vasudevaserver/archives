God the Creator finds it difficult
To tolerate me.
But God the creation
Not only tolerates me
But also tells me
That He will wait throughout Eternity
For wisdom-sun to dawn in my heart.

I asked God
If His Compassion-Eye
Was only for my imperfection-life.
God said to me:
"Definitely My Compassion-Eye
Is for your imperfection-life.
Also, My Compassion-Eye
Is for the acceleration
Of your soul's Heavenward speed."

Right now you do not need
A huge Everest-experience.

Or are you searching for my heart?

You will never be able to find it.

Lo and behold, it is there
Right in front of you!
