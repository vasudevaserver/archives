Inside your heart.
God feels your presence
Inside His Heart.
Therefore, He is happy.
If you want to be happy,
Then bring God and keep God
Inside your mind.

Do you want to know
The Will of God?
Then do two things:
Become and remain
Your heart's streaming tears.
You do not have to strive
To know the Will of God.
Your soul on its own will tell you
What God's Will is.
Your soul wants and needs from you
Only one thing:
An ever-deepening meditation.

Therefore, why do we hesitate
To go to the right person
Who is all eagerness to bless us
With fulfilment?
Who is the right person?
None other than your own highest self!

Just by sleeplessly listening
To the dictates of our soul,
The direct representative of God.

The seekers join God's side
And play along with Him
Against the undivine and unlit forces.
God's side, without fail,
Will eventually win.
