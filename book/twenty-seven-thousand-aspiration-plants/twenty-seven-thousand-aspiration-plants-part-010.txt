Do you know what my mind

And that God is powerfully encouraging,
Appreciating and loving my heart.

My mind, heart and soul
All work for my Lord Supreme.
My mind demands a high salary.
In order to keep peace,
My Lord grants my mind
A high salary.
My heart needs only a low salary.
God grants my heart a low salary
And thus satisfies my heart.
My soul does not want any salary.
It works for God for free
And is all gratitude to Him
For using it as His instrument.
God says to my soul,
"You are My Eternity's Pride,
My Infinity's Joy
And My Immortality's Love."
