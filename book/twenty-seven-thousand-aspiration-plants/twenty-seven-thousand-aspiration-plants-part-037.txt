If you have a mind,
Then keep it always ready
To receive from God.

If you have a heart,
Then keep it always ready
To hold God.

When you are at the foot
Of the aspiration-mountain.
But you will definitely
Feel yourself alone
When you are on the highest peak
Of the mountain.

Where hope is.
Do you know where it is?

Of my heart-garden
Whom did I see?

And nobody else.

To allow you to become a student
In his illumination-class.

How I can believe God
When He tells me
That my mind has
The same capacity as my heart
In cultivating
