Of spiritual awakening.

And then God wakes man.

Your screaming vital,
How will you ever see
Your life's sunrise?

If your love is in transit
To devotion
And your devotion is in transit
To surrender,
God will cheerfully and proudly
Tell you His Code-Name
So you can invoke Him
At any time you want.

Do you think that God
Does not want to retire?
He does want to retire!
He has time and again asked
The cosmic gods
To arrange His retirement party,
And each time the cosmic gods
Are obliged to refuse.
But the more God asks them
For this special favour,
The stronger become their hearts'
Failure-pangs
For not having transformed
Humanity's life.
