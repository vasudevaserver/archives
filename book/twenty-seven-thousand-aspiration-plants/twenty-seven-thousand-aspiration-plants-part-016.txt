If others cannot appreciate
Your self-offering
And cannot offer their gratitude,
It is their loss,
For they are not making progress.
You just continue
Offering your services
Soulfully and devotedly
To your Beloved Supreme
And you will make
The fastest progress.

That you are meant for the highest Reality,

There is an inner elevator,
And this elevator is nothing other than
Your heart's unconditional obedience-light.
