From imagination to inspiration
Is a very short step.
From inspiration to aspiration
Is a long step.
From aspiration to realisation
Is a larger-than-the-largest step.
From realisation to God-manifestation
Is a birthless and deathless step.

When you separate
The lower self of a human being
From his higher self,
The lower self
Remains untransformed,
And the higher self
Is not totally satisfied,
For it does not have anyone
To play with at its own level.
