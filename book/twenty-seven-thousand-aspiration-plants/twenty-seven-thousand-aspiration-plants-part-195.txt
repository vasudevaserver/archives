Our true education
Comes from self-giving,
And self-giving
Comes from the cheerful acceptance
Of God's earth-illumining
And Heaven-fulfilling Will.

To doubt anybody or anything,
Except when it is a matter
Of doubting falsehood
And one's constant incapacities.

To think that
Our imagination, inspiration,
Aspiration and realisation
Can work overtime.

My Lord, when You think of me,
Do You know that You look
Beautiful?
My Lord, when You show
Your Compassion to me,
Do you realise that You look
More beautiful?
My Lord, when You forgive me,
Do You realise that You look
Infinitely more beautiful?
My Lord, I am not flattering You.
It is absolutely true.
