The day he became a God-seeker
Was the beginning of his conscious
Feeling of Immortality.
On that day he came to know
That he is part and parcel
Of Immortality.
On that day he realised
That he represents Immortality
On earth.
On that day he became
A pathfinder and harbinger
Of Immortality
For those on earth who will accept
The spiritual life after him.

The entire earth-consciousness
In and through these
Specially selected instruments

In the earth-bound sky.
My sweet Lord,
Do give my mind the capacity to fly
Like my soul-bird
In the blue-vast sky
Where there is no fear,
No doubt, no death
But only the dawn
Of an ever-blossoming Immortality.

My sweet Lord,
Do tell me how I can be
Always faithful to You.
"My child,
If you want to be faithful to Me
All the time,
Then you must remain cheerful
All the time."

My sweet Lord,
How can I remain cheerful
All the time?
"My child,
You can remain cheerful
All the time
If you can only make yourself feel
That I am always pleased with you.
This is not a false belief
But the sincere awakening
Of your true life
Deep inside My Heart."

My sweet Lord,
Do tell me how old You are.

I am very pleased with your question.
I shall answer your question
And also answer one more question
Which you may want to ask Me
Some other time:
How young I am.
My child,
I am as old
As your heart's inner cry
And as young
As your life's outer smile."

My sweet Lord,
Do You want me to learn
The art of concentration?
Do You want me to learn
The art of meditation?
Do You want me to learn
The art of contemplation?

"My child,
I want you to learn them one by one.
If you learn concentration-art,
Then you will be able to enter
Into the end of time.
If you learn meditation-art,
Then you will be able to bring
Right in front of you
The birthless and deathless Time.
If you learn contemplation-art,
Then you will see that you are at once
The birthless, deathless and endless Time
And the Time
Of the ever-transcending Beyond."

My sweet Lord
Do You want me
To conquer the world
Or do You want the world
To conquer me?
I shall be equally pleased
In either case.

"My child,
I do not want you either
To conquer the world
Or to be conquered by the world.
I want you to conquer
Your own outer world
And your own inner world.
Finally, I want you to conquer Me
Once and for all.
To conquer your outer world
What you need
Is a volcano-will.
To conquer your inner world
What you need
Is an aspiration-mountain.
To conquer Me
What you need
Is your soul-beauty's gratitude-heart."

O my doubting mind,
You only know how to boast.
You never dare to defend me
When I vehemently argue
With the boatman of ignorance.
But my loving heart always defends me.
It immediately comes to the fore
To protect and fulfil me.
O my doubting mind,
I do not need you anymore.
O my loving heart,
You and I are for each other
Always.
