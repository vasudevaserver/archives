Wide open all the time
For Me, only for Me."

My Lord Supreme,
Why is it that I do not listen to You?
"You do not listen to Me, My child,
Because you do not consciously feel
That you need Me.
There is no other reason
And there can be no other reason."

Those who believe and then see
Are infinitely better instruments
Than those who must first see
Before they believe.
Believe and become one
With your Master's vision.
Then you will easily be able to see
Your own progress
And God's Manifestation.

What is flowing
From his own heart.

From his heart
To help him sit at the mystic Feet

He has been transcending himself
Faster than the fastest
Right from his childhood -

My Lord Supreme,
Will I ever please You
In Your own Way?

The very fact that you have asked
This soulful question
Means that there shall come a time
When you will definitely please Me
In My own Way,
Not only sleeplessly
But also unconditionally."
