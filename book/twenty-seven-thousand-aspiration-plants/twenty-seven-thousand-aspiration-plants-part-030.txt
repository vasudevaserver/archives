If you are not inspired
To improve your spiritual vocabulary,
Your life's dreams
Will never be transformed
Into reality.

My heart's
Two secret and sacred longings:
I shall please God
In God's own Way.

My past failure-life.

Are now unanimous
In their decision:
They will study at the heart-school,
And the only teacher
Will be the soul.

God wants each and every human being
To hoist His Victory-Banner.
But who is ready?

For the hero-instrument
Who will hoist His Victory-Banner.

How to expose himself, either.
