How to know
When you have realised God?
The day you can look in the mirror
And use your inner will power
To see not only your face
But countless other faces
In and around your face,
And know that these faces
Are all yours -- 
On that day you will know
That you have realised God.

Concentration on the physical,
In the process of evolution,
Humanity will achieve
More confidence-light,
More success-might
And more progress-delight
In the body-consciousness.

My Lord Supreme,
When I realise You,
Will I be different?
"Yes, My child!
Previously you thought
You were meant to live
An ordinary human life.
But when you realise Me,
You will feel that you have
Something very special
To do for Me on earth."
