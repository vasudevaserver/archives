An utterly foolish thing to say:
"I do not need God."
An utterly foolish thing to do:
To stop my oneness-dance
With the will of my soul.

My mind has made
Many complaints to God
Against the world.
God tells my mind
That no complaints will ever be able
To make the dark day of the world bright.
But if the mind unconditionally surrenders
To God's Will,
That will make the world
Brighter than the brightest.

Can and must come and repeat itself

In the entire span of a life.

That God's Hour strikes only once,
And never, never twice.
