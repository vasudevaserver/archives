Takes a very, very long time
To reach my Lord’s
Heavily burdened Ears.

My Lord,
Do You ever get tired?
“My child, I do.
I get tired when I read
The lengthier than the lengthiest
Complaint-list from My children
Against My creation.”

My Lord Beloved Supreme,
Out of Your infinite Bounty,
You have made me
A mountain-success.
Now I pray to You to make me
A fountain-progress.

My Lord Beloved Supreme,
Today I have a volley of questions.
“My child, I am all ready.”
My Lord,
Where does my obedience stand
In my spiritual life?
“My child, your obedience
Is your pre-school course.”
My Lord,
Where does my love stand
In my spiritual life?
“My child, your love
Is the kindergarten course.”
My Lord,
Where does my devotion stand
In my spiritual life?
“My child, your devotion
Is the primary school course.”
My Lord,
Where does my surrender stand?
“My child, your surrender
Is your high school course.”
My Lord,
My unreserved surrender,
Where does it stand?
“My child,
Your unreserved surrender
Is your college course.”
My Lord,
My unconditional surrender,
Where does it stand?
“My child,
Your unconditional surrender
Is your university course.”
My Lord,
Where does my sleepless, breathless
And unconditional surrender stand?
“My child,
That is your Ph.D. course.”

My Lord,
When I exploit Your indulgence,
What happens to me?
“My child,
You are the one to feel and know
What happens when you exploit
My indulgence.”
My Lord,
We all talk about self-indulgence.
What actually is self-indulgence?
“My child,
Self-indulgence drastically reduces
The God-oneness-dream-capacity.”

My Lord,
Will I ever be able to please You
In Your own Way?
“My child,
You will be able to please Me
In My own Way
Only when you live on earth
Only for me,
And not for your doubting,
Criticising, suspecting, torturing
And annihilating mind.”
