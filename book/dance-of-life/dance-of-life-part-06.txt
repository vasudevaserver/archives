CURRENT EVENTS

God has at last found
A home on earth.
Man's gratitude
Has agreed to grant God
A temporary shelter.

Man is tired of his frustration.

Human doubt is doubting
Its proud judgement
And sure assurance.

Man's pleasure-life
Has realised its folly
And it now wants the joy-life
To replace its long-standing career.

MY RIGHTS

I stood up for my rights.
My rights demanded
The life of universal acceptance
And the life of universal recognition.

I stand up for my rights.
My rights demand
My heart's cry and my life's smile.

I shall stand up for my rights.
My rights shall demand
The surrender-moon
From the world of aspiration-sun.

Gratitude.
Gratitude to God's Compassion,
Gratitude to man's service,
Gratitude to the thought of my self-transcendence,
Gratitude to my self-enquiry,
Gratitude to my God-discovery.
