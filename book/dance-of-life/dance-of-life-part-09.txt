A JOINT BANK ACCOUNT

God and I
Have a joint bank account.
He earns and deposits;
I neither earn nor deposit.
"Son," He says, "why don't you
Withdraw and buy your desires
So that at the end of the year
We shall be paying
Less income tax to Satan?
And also for another reason
I would like you to withdraw
Our wealth from the bank:
If you issue cheques to others,
The world will see that
You and I are good partners,
Loving partners, eternal partners."

I AM NOT GOING TO TALK BACK

I am not going to talk back
To anyone any more.
No, not even to God.
Let Him scold me,
Let Him insult me.
I shall prove to Him
That I have not one,
But three striking qualities:
I know how to hear,
I know how to bear,
I know how to transfigure.
Of course,
It is for our mutual good.

If I become perfect,
God will definitely be proud of me.
If I become perfect,
I won't have to fight
Constantly against Him.

MY MIRROR

In the morning
When I look in my mirror
I see the face of pure aspiration.

At noon
When I look in my mirror
I see the face of sad dissatisfaction.

In the evening
When I look in my mirror
I see that I am totally lost.

At night
When I look in my mirror
I see my broken heart
Replaced by God's Heart of Determination,
And my sunken face
Replaced by God's Perfection-Grace.
