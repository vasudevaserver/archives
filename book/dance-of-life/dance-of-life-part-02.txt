Athwart the arch of blue-gold Heaven,
Dissolving the negative intruders,

At long last, today
My challenge has been accepted.
Enlightenment fondly braves
The untiring searcher.

IN QUEST OF THE SATISFACTION-QUEEN

His life was an infinitude of quest.
Satisfaction denied him her presence.
Helpless he was.
Miserable he became.

From deep within lovingly announced:
"Argue not with your brooding self.
Satisfaction-queen will be yours.
Your meditation shall shake hands
with God-manifestation.
God-manifestation shall shake hands
with your perfection."

Will change my face and fate.
My surrender supreme
Shall marry my dream-boat
With my reality-shore.

There was a time when I loved
The fantastic fabrics of the mind.

Splintered, broken and smashed.
But now a lucid illumination
Steals into my heart.
The eternal Presence
Of Infinity's Light
Feeds my Vision's Dawn.

The world of temptation has captured your vital.
The world of depression has devoured your body."

And be the song of Transformation-Light.
Tomorrow you will give me the power
To conquer my giant "I"

NOW I AM HAPPY

I was not happy,
Although my fame reached
Unprecedented heights.
I was not happy,
Although the world kissed
The dust of my feet.
I was not happy,
Although God offered me
His Transcendental Pride.
But now I am happy,
Because
The Blossoms of my service-tree
Have all been devoured
By man's ignorance-night and
God's Blessing-Light.
