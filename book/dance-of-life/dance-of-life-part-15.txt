Were you a little unkind

Reluctance and rejection?
Why? Why?
Why did you torture her?

"Stop! Stop!
For my Kali's sake, at least!
Public mockery
Is merciless.
I wanted
To avoid it
Always."

But it was you
Who instructed
Your disciples:
'Man or worm.'

"I see, I see.
Now listen,
Once and for all.
My wisdom
Did not permit me
To help the puny ignorance
Of the tiny worm
Grow into elephant-ignorance.
Therefore, I avoided
Sarada's and my joint appearances
In the assembly
Of lightless society."
