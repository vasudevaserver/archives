Master, God has blessed me with money;
You now bless me with realisation.

Your money is the connecting link
Between
God the temptation
And
God the frustration.

Jealousy is a twenty-man procession.

Doubt is a hundred-man procession.

Love is a ten million-man procession.
Once it reaches its destination, Illumination,
It never returns.
