THE BUDDHA'S PROBLEMS

Lord Buddha,
Your first problem was suffering.
Your second problem was desire.
Your third problem was ignorance.
Your fourth problem was the absence of inner light.
All your problems
You solved
Eternally for yourself.
And now the Heart that
You left behind on earth
Is trying and crying,
Crying and trying
To solve the same
Giant problems.
As you succeeded,
So also your Heart
Will succeed,
Without fail.

LET US UNITE OUR POSSESSIONS

Lord, since I am unable
To give up my desiring mind,
Is there any way I can get
Some benefit from this mind?
"Real benefit? No!
Real progress? No!
Take your present mind as unreality.
Then you will get
Whatever you want."

What is real, Lord?
"Daughter, your aspiration is real."
What else is real?
"My Compassion is real."

Lord, what are we supposed
To do with my aspiration
And Your Compassion?
"Daughter, we are supposed
To unite our possessions
So that we can sing the song
Of perfect Perfection
Together."

Persistence deserted him,
Defeat-King came to him
Out of pity
And embraced him.
Otherwise, Defeat-King would have remained
Quiet, absolutely quiet.
Therefore it is not proper
To curse the poor well-intentioned
Defeat-King.

When
Devotion deserted him,
Ignorance-Queen came to him
Out of compassion
And garlanded him.
Otherwise, Ignorance-Queen would have remained
Silent, absolutely silent.
Therefore it is undivine
To accuse the poor well-intentioned
Ignorance-Queen.

You know, Father,
There is only one thing on earth
That gives me infinite joy,
And that is to sit at Your Feet
And drink the Nectar-Delight
Of Your Eyes.
Your Feet are my only
Heaven and Haven.
If I equal You
My life of devotion will die,
My life of surrender will die.
To me, my devotion is everything;
To me, my surrender is everything.
Father, I pray and pray to You
To live above me at least a trillion miles
Forever
So that I can, through eternity,
Live at Your Feet
And
Treasure Your Feet."
