WHY IS SURRENDER SO GREAT?

Why is surrender so great?

Surrender is great
Because it accepts
Cheerfully
What it does not understand
Remotely.

Also,
It does not care to understand
Vaguely
Anything whatsoever.
It only believes and obeys,
And
Obeys and believes.

Surrender is by far the greatest
Because it alone is the glowing ascent
Of the aspiring heart
And
The proud descent
Of the Absolute.

Father, Father,
Why are You
Not taking my services
Nowadays?
"Daughter, not true!"

Father, Father,
Why don't You
Care for me at all
Nowadays?
"Not true, not true, not true,
My daughter sweet!"

INFINITY

When I say:
"Infinity is this,
Infinity is that,"
I decrease Infinity's Length
With my binding mind.

When I say:
"Infinity is something more,
Infinity is something deeper,"
I increase Infinity's Life
With my expanding heart.

I AM YOURS, ONLY YOURS

Father, Father,
You are ignoring me incredibly.
I think this is enough.
Please, please
Give me another chance.
This time I shall please You.

Father, Father,
Every day I see You
Deliberately kicking me
Farther and farther
Away from You.
I think this is enough,
More than enough.
Please, please,
Give me another chance.
This time I shall please You.

Father, Father,
Still I think
I am Yours,
Only Yours.
