WHAT TO LOOK FOR

What to look for
In God -
A sweet smile.

What to look for
In man -
An iota of gratitude.

What to look for
In Heaven -
A flood of compassion.

What to look for
On earth -
An island of peace.

What to look for
In life -
A particle of satisfaction.

What to look for
In death -
A song of immortality.

SURPRISING NEWS

God has
Surprising news for him.
God will give him
Aspiration today
And
Realisation tomorrow,
Far beyond his expectation
And
Far beyond his imagination.

He has
Surprising news for God.
At last he is ready to offer
Ignorance, his best friend, to God.
He is even prepared to offer
His own self, the desire incarnate, to God.

TWO INSTRUMENTS OF DEATH

Two instruments of death:
Fear and doubt.
I employed them
For a long time
To serve me
And
Please me.

They served me
Day in and day out.
I was really and truly
Pleased with them
And
Proud of them.

Recently faith, an instrument of God,
Came to me
Looking for a job.
I immediately employed faith.

To my wide surprise,
Faith chased away
My previous workers.
Now faith alone
Does everything for me,
From morn to eve
And
From eve to morn.

THREE TIMES

Three times
I looked for a hiding place.
Alas, each time
I failed.

First time
I looked for a hiding place in God.
God did not allow me
To hide inside Him.

He said
I am too restless,
I would not stay inside Him
For good.

He said to me
That I have to
Hide inside Him either
Forever or never.

He knew that I would not
Be able to stay inside Him forever.
Therefore, He did not care
To fulfil my prayer.

Second time
I looked for a hiding place in man.
Alas, it all ended in vain.

Man said to me,
"I shall allow you to hide inside me
On one condition.
You have to offer me daily
A sea of gratitude
And
A sea of plenitude."

I immediately told man
That his demands were extravagant,
Impossible and unthinkable.
I left man with my transcendental disgust.

Third and last time
I looked for a hiding place
Inside Ignorance-sea.
Lo, I have done it.

And nothing need I
Offer my Ignorance-sea in return.
Here I shall hide,
I shall eternally hide.

Indeed you are great.
But
I wish to mix with the believer,
Because he is good.

O Believer,
Indeed you are good.
But
I wish to offer my love to the seeker,
Because he is divine.

O Seeker,
Indeed you are divine.
But
I wish to live with the unconditional server,
Because he is perfect.

MY DAUGHTER HAS NO EQUAL

Doubt says to God
"God, why do You love
Your daughter, Faith, so much?"

"I love My daughter
Because she does not argue with Me,
Because she does not question Me,
Because she always believes in Me,
Because she does not ask Me to make her understand
What I say to her.
She accepts My Will devotedly,
She executes My Will unconditionally.
I tell you, Doubt,
Here on earth, in My vast creation
My daughter has no equal."
