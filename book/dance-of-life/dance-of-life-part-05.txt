THE STORY OF PERHAPS

When he lives in the mind
He speaks to the fruitless perhaps.

When he lives in the heart
He sings for the hopeless perhaps.

When he lives in the vital
He plays with the worthless perhaps.

When he lives in the body
He dances with the lifeless perhaps.

Foolishly I wasted time.

Because
Time knows that I am
An unimportant member,
A beggar in the universal family of beggars.

Whenever righteousness declines
And
Unrighteousness prevails,

And save, elevate and illumine the snow-white hearts.
Since then, how many times
Have you appeared and disappeared
From the earth-scene?

The absolute Supreme is not going to fire me
Even if I hopelessly fail to stick to my well-intentioned promise."

I SEARCHED AND SEARCHED

I searched and searched
For my soul.
At last I found my soul in the Flute of Krishna.

I searched and searched
For my heart.
At last I found my heart in the Cross of Christ.

I searched and searched
For my mind.
At last I found my mind in the Meditation of Buddha.

I searched and searched
For my vital.
At last I found my vital in the Life of Vivekananda.

I searched and searched
For my body.
At last I found my body on the Lap of the Supreme.
