In man's absence
My fondness-tree proudly grows.

In God's absence
My life-tree helplessly dies.

O man and God,
I tell you
My supreme secret:
Ignorance misses my absence,
Earth cherishes my absence,
Heaven terminates my absence.

Without sweat
I acquired teeming doubts.
Without regret
I threw them away.

Without sweat
I grabbed ignorance-night.
Without regret
I killed its life.

With much sweat

If I ever lose it
My life-boat shall sink.

With much sweat
I have discovered an iota of Light.
If I ever lose it,
I shall become a soulless creature.
