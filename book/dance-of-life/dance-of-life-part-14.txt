NO SUCH THING

I took a closer look.
There is no such thing as ignorance.
Ignorance is nothing
But my limited knowledge.

I took a closer look.
There is no such thing as defeat.
Defeat is nothing
But the inspirer
Of my increasing will.

I took a closer look.
There is no such thing as death.
Death is nothing
But my strengthening
And
Dreaming rest.
