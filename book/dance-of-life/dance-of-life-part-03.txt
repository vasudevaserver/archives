#+BEGIN_VERSE

Realisation is the one-way ticket
From the man-station
To the God-junction.

Manifestation is the round-trip ticket.

Aspiration is the money-power
That buys the ticket.

Surrender divine needs no ticket,
No money-power.
It has what it needs:
The Compassion-Feet
   Of the Lord Supreme.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

You are sensitive to noise
       Because
You have not invented
   The Atom Bomb
       And
   The Hydrogen Bomb.

You are sensitive to noise
       Because
The outer world's vast achievement is determined
       Not
To touch your feet.

You are sensitive to noise
       Because
God the Player divine,
God the Singer eternal,
God the Dancer immortal,
Has not claimed you in Heaven
As His partner on earth.
