IN MY OWN WAY

Father, I think of You so much,
Do You ever think of me?
"Daughter, I do think of you.
But I think of you in My own Way."
Father, I meditate on You so much.
Do You ever meditate on me?
"Daughter, I do meditate on you.
But I meditate on you in My own Way.
Father, I love You so much.
Do You love me?
"Daughter, I do love you.
But I love you in My own Way."
Father, what will happen
If You once please me in my own way?
"Daughter, if I please you
In your own way,
Your little 'i' will be overfed and fall sick
And die before it gets its own Illumination,
And
Your divine Self will starve,
And remain unmanifested.
Further, this will engender
My immediate death."

You are mercilessly
Avoided by others'

Absurdity and impossibility
Come into your broken heart
Only to destroy
Your entire existence.

I BELIEVE IN ONENESS

I believe in oneness.
A child adds his achievements
To his parents' achievements.
Thus the three become one.
Here I hear the song of oneness,
Here I see the dance of oneness,
Here I feel the reality of oneness.
But for me to say
A child's achievements
Equal his father's achievements
Or
His mother's achievements
Is sheer stupidity.
You are on the top of the life-tree,
He is in the middle of the life-tree,
I am at the foot of the life-tree.
How can our achievements
Be equal?
But we are one,
Undoubtedly one,
Because we have established
Our inseparable oneness
With the life-tree.

We miss so badly.
His heart of compassion
We miss so sadly.
His soul of illumination
We miss so unmistakably.
Alas, he is gone!
No more our saint is with us.
