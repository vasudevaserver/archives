HE AND HIS

He and his ego worship each other,
He and his doubt love each other,
He and his fear torture each other,
He and his failure hate each other,
He and his perfection reject each other,
He and his death live in each other.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

YOUR INGRATITUDE IS AN EXCEPTION

Your pride confuses my mind.
Your pride amuses my heart.
Your life receives nothing but
A ceaseless tribute from the foolish world.
I know not how
Your swollen head
And
Your sunken mind
Live together.
You know not how to implore,
You know not how to explore,
You know only how to explode.
Here on earth,
There in heaven
Nothing grows without nourishment.
But
Your ingratitude is an exception,
Indeed, an unbelievable exception.

His is not a hopeless case;
God in him is still alive,
Vividly alive.

To win the best in life,
We must learn in the mind
The lessons given us by the heart.
