* Part I -- Introduction: a talk to disciples

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: discourse

 :cite-key: HM:1
  :END:


Sometimes I get a few complaints from some of my disciples. They say that they have not made any progress and that there is no hope of their making progress in the future. But I wish to tell them that a student's spiritual progress can be judged only by a spiritual Master. You will ask how the aspirant cannot be aware of his own progress. But I wish to say that the aspirant becomes aware of his own progress only when he becomes truly advanced.

We expect everything sooner than at once. We all want to be God-realised souls overnight. It is an excellent idea, a great aim that all of us cherish; but we have to know where we actually stand. To be very frank, some of you are absolute beginners in the spiritual life. I am not trying to discourage you, far from it; only this is just a bare statement of fact. Again, you have to know that he who is a beginner today can easily become an expert tomorrow. But at the very beginning of our journey, if we feel that God-realisation will dawn on us tomorrow or in the near future, it will be a deplorable mistake. We have to go step by step. Before we go through kindergarten, if we want to enter into the university, it will be a ridiculous idea.

God-realisation does not come by hook or by crook. Years of spiritual discipline, iron discipline, are necessary in order to have higher and deeper spiritual experiences. Then, from these experiences, we enter into a deeper region which we call the region of realisation. This region also has to be surpassed in order to enter into the real realisation, the absolute realisation -- in other words, God-realisation. I am not throwing cold water on you. I only wish to say that each spiritual aspirant or seeker must have infinite patience, and his patience is nothing but inner light and inner wisdom.

To my sorrow, some of you do not even follow the basic spiritual disciplines. First of all, there is nothing as important as regularity in the spiritual life. Today some of you meditate at six o'clock in the morning, tomorrow at four o'clock, the day after at eleven or twelve o'clock. Then again, there are some who meditate only once a week, or once in a blue moon. This is deplorable. Regularity must be practised. If it is at seven o'clock that you meditate, please try to meditate every day at seven o'clock. If it is at eight o'clock, then every day meditate at eight o'clock. Your inner being will never take any responsibility for you if you are not regular in your spiritual life.

Along with regularity, please try to have purity in your body, vital, mind, heart and soul. It is in purity that God's Breath abides. The purity of the body is of paramount importance in the spiritual life. If physical purity is lacking in a human being, then it is simply impossible for the Divine Being to breathe in that particular individual. Then, along with physical purity, there also has to be cleanliness in the body. I am sure all of you take baths at least once a day. What we call "cleanliness" in the outer world, in the inner world we call "purity." There also has to be purity in the mind. If your mind is roaming here and there, if your mind is cherishing all kinds of undivine thoughts, then purity is just a far cry. So physical purity, mental purity and vital purity are all of paramount importance.

Before you actually start to meditate, no matter what time it is, please wash your eyes, ears and nose. You should use cold water and not hot water or warm water. Then, you have to know that it is always better to meditate in a seated position. Of course, when you are spiritually more developed you can meditate while lying down, while standing, while running, while eating, while talking. But right now, you should meditate at home in a quiet spot. You need not sit cross-legged; you can sit in a chair or you can sit on your sofa. But try to keep your spine erect and straight. These are the basic things that you must know.



* Part II -- The Master's presence

* Question: What is your process for enlightenment and what do you ask of your disciples?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:2
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ There is only one thing that I ask of my disciples: to aspire. By aspiration we mean inner cry. We cry for name and fame in the outer world, but in the inner world we cry for peace, light and bliss in infinite measure. So I ask my disciples to cry inwardly to achieve peace, light and bliss and to grow into peace, light and bliss.



* Question: Do you teach people to meditate in a specific way?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:3
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ There are many to whom I have not given any specific meditation, because it is not necessary. When I meditate with you people, my very presence is enough to bring the soul forward and let the soul meditate. Some of you people say, "I don't know how to meditate," but you do not know that when you meditate with me, my main task is to bring the soul forward so that your soul will meditate in and through you. Again, if you can consciously create a pure vibration and a sincere attitude, then it is easier for the soul to remain to the fore and to receive everything. So you don't have to learn any specific meditation, because it comes through my eyes. When you are looking at my eyes, at that time if your soul is hungry for peace, then peace will enter into you. If your soul is hungry for light, then light will enter. If it is hungry for any spiritual qualities, they will enter. The mind may not understand, but the mind is not at all necessary for meditation.

Sometimes when the soul is receiving peace, light and bliss, it wants to assimilate them. Again, sometimes even before the soul assimilates the qualities, it wants to express them. Now assimilation is always good and expression is also good. In some cases we see that the souls are eager to assimilate and keep something for fifteen or twenty days, or for five days or perhaps just five hours. and then express it. In other cases we see that the soul wants to reveal, manifest and express these qualities immediately, in a day or a few hours' time. If assimilation is not complete, then proper expression is not impossible, but it is very difficult. Again, sometimes it is quite possible to express it.

Today while we were meditating, two people's souls did not want to assimilate. One young man's throat centre, the centre of expression, immediately wanted to express what it received. He very powerfully said, "Now I have got it, and I want to give it to others immediately. He did not try to assimilate at all; he just wanted to express. What his soul did is not bad at all.

Now, in another young man's case, his soul wanted to express something, but his vital came forward, saying, "No, no, no! The best thing is to keep it like a miser who saves his money." He started giving it out, but then he began assimilating instead. The rest of the disciples all assimilated whatever they got from me. Only these two individuals did not want to; they wanted to express what they could, although the second one decided to assimilate at the last minute. Now, this expression can be to others, to the atmosphere or to the universal Consciousness. Sometimes it is like knowledge: the more you give, the more you get. Someone may feel, "Let me read for one hour and give as I receive." Again, someone else may say, "No, let me learn more, and then I will give. Let me read for two hours and afterwards give." It is like knowledge to some extent, but it cannot be compared with human knowledge.

However, if you want to be in a position to give constantly to the world at large, you have to realise God first, assimilate your realisation and then come with a special mission to give to mankind. Otherwise, before realising God, you have only partial light, partial truth. When you try to offer your light and truth, you will think you have a big heart. Instead of saving it to get one hundred dollars, which is your goal, you will say, "Oh, I have got one dollar. Let me give it to mankind." If someone is kind, he will take it from you and think, "He has only one dollar, but he is so generous. Whatever he has he gives." But if you are giving that one good dollar to an undeserving person or to someone who is vitally very strong, impure and obscure, he will just grab it and feel, "No, he is telling a lie. He has more than one dollar." He will act like a thief and say, "You have more money; you are not giving me enough." He will strike you and beat you in the inner world. When you have only one dollar to give, these forces are so strongly tempted. They feel that you have more wealth to give. They try to destroy your potentiality and possibility.



* Question: How can we meditate well?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:4
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Let us try to feed the Supreme with our meditation and aspiration. For my disciples, the easiest and most effective way of doing a good meditation is to enter into me, into my consciousness. Try to remain in my consciousness twenty-four hours a day. Then only can you rest assured that you are really safe in our boat. Otherwise, you may try to leave the boat. Then I will have to jump out of the boat and enter into the sea of ignorance to rescue you. Also, to get a good meditation, one has to have inner discipline and one has to know what the truth is, what aspiration is. This requires time. If God-realisation is your sole wish, then I wish to say, please meditate well.



* Question: Guru, how can we go deeper and deeper within so we can go beyond the surface mind?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:5
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ If you want to dig a well today, first you have to find an instrument to dig with. Then you start digging and continue until you are tired. The next day you will dig again, and the day after you will do the same. In this way you will work every day and make a little progress. That is how you will one day get water. So if you want to dig deep within yourself, if you want to get Immortality-Nectar, then you also have to dig regularly in the same way. But in this case the digging implement is your aspiration. This aspiration is like a magnet. The higher your aspiration goes, the deeper inward the magnet pulls you. Aspiration is the only tool, the only instrument, with which to dig the barren soil within you. As you go deep within the earth with outer implements when you dig for water, so also with aspiration you can dig deep within yourself in order to get Nectar, which is Immortality. It is only a matter of regular daily practice.

You have accepted the spiritual life and you want to make progress. You may meditate once a day or once a week or once a month; or you may say, "No, I wish to meditate three times a day. What is wrong with me? I eat three times a day. Why can't I meditate at least three times a day? And if I spend an hour for my luncheon and an hour for my dinner, then can I not also spend at least two hours in meditation?" But here we have to know that meditation is not like eating earthly food. If your mind is roaming all the time, you can spend hours and hours in meditation but you will make no progress. If you spend two hours in meditation, then out of those two hours perhaps you can meditate well for only five minutes. Again, if you say, "I am selecting five minutes and as soon as I enter into meditation, I will have a most sublime meditation," usually it does not happen, especially in the case of beginners or new seekers.

So what all of you should try to do is this: if you want to meditate well for fifteen minutes, try to keep aside one hour for your meditation. Then during that hour, consider forty-five minutes as being only for your preparation or for allowing your mind to roam in the world of fantasies. Of course, this is not the ideal thing, but you have to feel that right now you are helpless. So you can keep aside forty-five minutes for your own purpose and then meditate well for fifteen minutes.

Again, you may feel that if you sit down for fifteen minutes, you will be able to meditate well and you won't need forty-five minutes extra. You may feel that you don't have to take a few preliminary starts before you run the race. Before a sprinter runs the full distance of one hundred metres, he runs twenty or thirty metres in order to warm up, so that his body can be properly co-ordinated. So the same principle can be applied here. If it is necessary, we shall take a few practice starts. And if it is not necessary, then right away we shall cover the hundred metre distance, that is to say, we shall go deep within.



* Question: I am strongly tuned to the mental plane. What can I do to enter into my inner being and feel my inner self more in my daily meditations?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:6
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Try to think that you have three things in your possession: the soul, the heart and the mind. In your case one possession, the mind, the intellectual mind, is suffering because it has been given very good training at Yale and now you are neglecting it. Try to take the mind as a possession, but feel that it is a very heavy burden on your shoulders. Who wants to place a heavy burden on his shoulders? Feel that you can easily take off this load; you can get rid of the gross physical mind.

Your heart is another possession. When you think of or try to feel the heart, feel that there is something inside the heart and that is why it is beautiful and meaningful. Your last possession is your soul, which represents reality and divinity. The soul needs a heart. The heart needs a soul. The soul is a seed; the heart is a tree. The seed needs the tree; and if there is no seed there cannot be a plant. The heart-plant comes from the soul-seed; then the plant grows into a tree and the tree becomes a banyan tree. But first there must be a seed.

If the mind is creating problems, feel that you don't need the earthbound mind. You have had enough use from it. Just take the heart as a plant and the soul as a seed. If you can grow into the consciousness of the seed, there will always be the possibility that the seed will germinate and you will grow into a plant and then into a tree.

Think of what will produce results. The conscious awareness of the soul will always create something ever new and vibrant. If something constantly grows inside you which is pure, divine and immortal, then automatically things that are not immortal and aspiring in the physical mind will be transformed because of the constant growth. They will be transformed and illumined if they have not already left. If the mind still remains a heavy load, it will be transformed. All you have to do is to give all importance to the seed, the soul. Then the physical mind will leave you or it will have to surrender to the flood of light inside the heart which is the soul.



* Question: Some days I feel that instead of meditating I want to say prayers or I want to do something for another person. Is that the ego?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:7
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ No. The best thing is to meditate every day. If you cannot meditate, then pray. But you cannot say that you only want to increase your selfless service and forget about your meditation. No! If you want to help people, then help people after you have done your meditation. You have to do the first thing first. You have to meditate. If you cannot meditate, you can pray. Ultimately, prayer and meditation will give you the same goal. But to go without praying or meditating is like going without money. Without any wealth, what are you going to have to give to others? If you pray, you acquire inner wealth; but if you don't have inner wealth you are like a beggar.

Then, when you have spiritual wealth, you must give your wealth to the right person, and not to the wrong person. There will be many who need your help, but if you give to the wrong person, then you are creating more problems for him and for yourself.



* Question: What do you do when you are not one hundred percent alert during meditation?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:8
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ First of all, before you start meditating, breathe in deeply a few times. Very deep breathing helps conscious awareness. If you still find yourself falling asleep and starting to enjoy the bliss of sleep, at that time you should say "No, let me enjoy the bliss of meditation." Instead of entering into other worlds you should say, "No, let me remain in this world. I won't even knock at the door of the sleep worlds. I shall stay here outside.

In meditation, movement is going on but in a very subtle, peaceful way. In it is the life that lifts us up towards the goal. But when we enter into sleep there is no life at all.

During your meditation you yourself will realise when, instead of getting a very dynamic inner thrill, you are entering into a world where there is no life at all. You should feel, "No, I want to enter into a place where there will be fulfilling and dynamic life."



* Question: Is it wrong to sleep in meditation if we have worked all night?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:9
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Sometimes even though you are exhausted you have to work very hard. Some doctors are runners and yet they have to train vigorously. During the day they work very hard and they can practice running only at night. An example is Dr. Roger Bannister, the first to run the four-minute mile. He was a doctor in England who could practise his running only at around eleven o'clock at night after a long day of work. He had a goal; so he practised hard and didn't make excuses.

You also have a goal in your life. Important things, such as functions, do not take place every day. Opportunities do not come every day in your life. If you use the opportunity you are gaining something. Spirituality is like an opportunity. If you miss one meditation you have to feel that you have missed something, you have covered one step less. When you don't do something regularly, your consciousness loses its capacity and the road becomes very long. For someone who does meditation every day it becomes very short. Insincere people say there will be another opportunity. But as the Supreme Himself is always progressing, if you miss one opportunity you have to feel that you have really lost something. Once you relax, ignorance has covered you. If you fail to get up once, then on that day ignorance has come to you.

I tell you, nobody has lost his body by praying and meditating. If you people say that someone has become exhausted and gone mad for God's sake, it is all lies. God is all Wisdom. So if you have worked very hard and do not think you can keep awake in your meditation you must ask your Master if he wants to excuse you.

Emotionally disturbed people try to push too fast and realise God overnight. But stable people do it gradually. Anybody will succeed if he prays or meditates. At one time my sincerity was to realise my God. Now my sincerity is my oneness with you people. Tomorrow you do not know what will happen, so avail yourselves of today's wealth. Parents say their children are very young and later they will pray or meditate; but that tomorrow will never come. To put things off is to be insincere. Feel that you have to do what is required immediately. Most of us believe in a future life, but we do not believe in the capacity of the immediate life.



* Question: Will visiting a holy place, such as the Himalayas, help our spiritual progress?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:10
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ In India all western tourists go to visit the Himalayas. When they come back from the Himalayas do you think they are God-realised? True, as in the past, even now Indian sages and seers meditate at the foot of the Himalayas, but God-realisation and meditation are two different things. Just because many have realised the Highest there, we are apt to say that this place will give us realisation and fulfilment immediately, but it is not so. It is not where we are that is important; it is the Will of God that will give us realisation.



* Question: I read a book about concentration and meditation in which it said that one should pay attention to the direction in which one is facing, whether it is to the East, South, West or North.

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:11
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ For concentration we do not need any particular direction: East, West, North or South. You can sit and concentrate in any direction. In India there are some who are not actually aspirants, but who are extremely eager to have the results of their prayers and desires. They feel that the South is the best because they believe that one of our gods, Ganesha, is situated in the South. They feel that before meditating one has to bow down to him and say, "I bow down to Ganesha." Ganesha, the son of Lord Shiva, is supposed to be the boon-giver. So if your meditation concerns the fulfilment of a desire which you would soon like to get, then I wish to say the South has some value. But the other corners, East, West and North, are of no use. That is the only thing that I can say about meditating in a particular direction.

But when concentration is concerned, there is no necessity of facing a particular way, because you are concentrating to enter into deeper meditation, to enter into your inner life. At that time you may even keep your eyes closed. Concentration does not mean that we have to always keep our eyes wide open. No, we can concentrate with our eyes closed. From the strict spiritual point of view, meditating facing one direction or another is all very foolish. You may say that the sun rises in the East and since the sun signifies the Creator, if you look at the East immediately you will get inspiration and aspiration. When the sun sets you see that all the world is now taking rest, spiritual sleep, inner sleep for nourishment. This means you will get double energy and dynamism for the morrow if you look at the West. Now, in India people look to the North because the Himalayas are there. They feel even the name Himalaya will immediately take them to God-realisation. In the West and even in the South of India people think that a touch of the Himalayas will give them God-realisation. This is a stupid feeling. There are thousands and millions of people living at the foot of the Himalayas but they are not realised. These theories are all mental fabrications.



* Part III -- Collective meditation and the master: a talk

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: discourse
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:12
  :END:


This is a collective meditation; that is to say, we all meditate together. In the beginning of today's meeting for about half an hour what I did was to bring down peace -- sublime and infinite peace. After that, I stood in front of each of you and entered into you to observe what the soul, the inner being, the outer being, the physical, the vital, the mind and the heart wanted at that particular moment. While I was doing this I must say, almost all of you aspired to have something or to grow into something. Your physical mind may not have been aware of your soul's immediate need, but your soul was spontaneously trying to bring to the fore the spiritual need, the inner need.

Sometimes I see that there is no aspiration. Some students do not want anything. It is not that they have everything; it is just that they do not have the inspiration to either draw something from above or to get something from me. With these students I just try to kindle the flame of aspiration. But if I stand in front of someone and see that that particular aspirant wants to have Peace, immediately I bring down Peace from above. If I see someone who wants Light, then I bring down Light. If a third person wants Power, I bring down Power. There are other divine qualities also. According to the aspiration, necessity and receptivity of each individual aspirant, I bring down spiritual, divine treasures from above.

There are some aspirants who get immediate inspiration and aspiration when they see that a great spiritual figure is standing in front of them, inspiring them or guiding them to speed up their spiritual life and spiritual progress. Those who are conscious of the fact that a spiritual person can do and does this act of upliftment in their spiritual life, are consciously benefiting from my spiritual presence.

I wish to add something more. The soul, as you know, right now is encaged; it is inside the body. At times during the aspirant's conscious or unconscious life, it wants to fly from one plane of consciousness to another. That is to say, it tries to go from the second plane to the third plane, and from the third plane to the fourth plane -- up, up, up. There are seven higher worlds and seven lower worlds of existence. If I see that the soul of a particular aspirant wants to have that experience of the soul's journey, then I do it for him. Today I have done that here with one particular seeker. And, of course, to each individual I have given my inner wealth according to the individual's aspiration and necessity.

Very often, just for a second during the meditation, the aspirant's soul feels my inner concern, love and blessings for him. Then it is blocked up for five, ten or fifteen minutes; then again it resumes its performance. Or at night, when the particular seeker is asleep, the soul of the person comes to me again to be benefited and to seek my guidance. That is also done.

So these are the major things that I do during the collective meditation. And once you can make a conscious contact with my soul, then you can rest assured that my existence on earth will act like your slave. Once anyone makes real contact with my soul and sincerely wants my help, then I am at his or her service forever. But this contact must be transformed into identification, and from identification into oneness. If a seeker can establish oneness between his soul and my soul, then I shall be always responsible for that particular human being. This is my soul's Assurance.



* Part IV -- Questions and answers

 :PROPERTIES:

  :END:



* Question: Can you please speak about collective meditation?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:13
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ When you meditate in a group, feel that ignorance is against you in a tug of war. So at whatever time the meditation is scheduled to begin, at that time you have to start pulling. It is like starting together in a race. Before a race, all the runners have to come and wait at the starting point. When the starter fires the gun, immediately the runners begin running. But if a runner is not at the starting point at the appointed hour, the starter does not wait for the latecomer. Today we are meditating in a group. When we meditate together, we have to know that we are meditating with the Supreme, in the Supreme and for the Supreme, against ignorance. We are not competing against anybody; we are competing against our inner weaknesses, inner imperfections. In order to conquer these forces, we have to run toward the Goal.

As each spiritual Master has a boat of his own, we are also in our own boat. Every day the Supreme is judging the passengers. Now I may scold you from time to time, but I wish to say that many who are in my boat are winning the race against ignorance. Although there are some who do not meditate well, some do meditate very well. Again, there is every chance, every fear, every apprehension that we may also lose mercilessly. We have been winning, true, but if we lose our capacity, ignorance may win. So please feel that only when we can see the smiling Face of the Supreme have we achieved everything. He is giving us this opportunity. He offers everyone the same opportunity, but so far it is only spiritual seekers who have availed themselves of it. Right now many new people are entering into our boat. This is the Supreme's wish that I am executing. A kind of self-complacency has developed in some of the older disciples who have been with us for four, five or six years, and this self-complacency is a danger to our mission. The new disciples will add new life to our inspiration and aspiration.



* Question: Why is it important to meditate with other people?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:14
  :END:

/Sri Chinmoy:/ If you have a friend who knows how to meditate, and if you meditate with him, even unconsciously you may receive inspiration from him. Then, automatically the power of meditation will increase in you and your ignorance will decrease. You will learn many things from your spiritual friends; you will be able to have a new perspective on life.



* Question: What are the ways to go deep within or raise our consciousness while meditating in a group?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:15
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ There are three ways. The first way is called japa, which is the incantation or repetition of a word or mantra. Then comes meditation. Then there is prayer.

Our best mantra is Aum. When we repeat it, it becomes japa. Kindly chant Aum most soulfully. Then while meditating. please don't allow any thought to enter; only feel that you are inside me, or inside the Himalayas, climbing high, higher, highest. When you do prayer, please try to feel that there is no competition at all in the spiritual life. Please try to do your best and feel that each individual is responsible for the best achievement, the best progress. Feel that today is your day and if you do well, the Supreme will be extremely pleased.



* Question: Guru, sometimes when you come into the meditation hall, you ask people not to stand up.

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:16
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Yes, I do it out of compassion. Sometimes, believe me, when I come inside, I see that you people are glued to your chairs. Why should I torture you? You have got the perfect nest, so why do I have to compel the birds to fly?



* Question: At the end of a meditation for the general public, what is actually happening when you stand up and put on a garland?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:17
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Towards the end of the meditation there are two things that I usually do. When I stand up and look at the seekers, I give them my last self-offering. This last self-offering is an inner shower, an inner rain. My soul brings down God's Compassion, especially His Compassion-Delight, from above. During the last few minutes I actually grow into a torrential rain. I literally see myself as rain. Only this rain does not create problems for the seekers. On the contrary, it helps them run as fast as they want.

When I put on the garland, it is not in any way an act of demonstration. I do not take it because I have worked very hard in the battlefield of life and deserve it. No, this garland I take as a garland of gratitude. I place it around my neck only to show that this garland is not mine: this garland is yours. I happen to be there acting as a leader, playing the role of the leader. You can say a self-imposed leader, if you want. But this leader is only receiving the garland on behalf of the group. During the meditation each individual member has added to the leader's self-offering. So I wear this garland on behalf of all the seekers. I am also a seeker. Although only one garland is at our disposal, this leader knows perfectly well that it is everybody's. I take the garland as a token of my gratitude to each of you, to the Supreme in each individual seeker.



* Question: Are outer gestures important for aspiration to increase?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:18
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Some outer gestures are useful for seekers. You have put candles, incense and flowers in the meditation room to increase your aspiration. They will not increase my aspiration, for I have already realised God. If you are going to realise God tomorrow or in two years, then for you also, these outer things will have no value. These flowers, candles and incense have no value for realised souls or for seekers on the verge of realisation. But if you know that God-realisation is still a far cry, then these things will definitely increase your aspiration. When you are in a very high spiritual mood and you fold your hands, you are not folding your hands to me or touching my feet. No, when you fold your hands you are bowing to your own aspiring self. Let us consider the body as two halves, a lower and a higher part. Your lower half wants to become one with the higher half. Although I represent both the higher and lower selves, just because of my realisation I am well-established in the higher world.

Unfortunately you are not yet well-established in the higher world. But even though I am in the higher world, if I take off my legs and only my upper portion remains, and then if I want to stand, I will not be able to. I need my lower part just as much as I need my higher part. I need them equally for illumination, I have to have constant communication and oneness between my higher and lower parts. When you fold your hands with an immediate inner feeling, your lower self is becoming one with your higher self. Then there is a continuous, sweet feeling, like a river flowing into the ocean.

The seeker is the river, and the Master is the ocean. The natural course of the river is to flow into the ocean. Then it will become the ocean. But if the river does not feel that it must merge with the ocean, then even if it sees the ocean it will take a wrong course or just meander aimlessly. The seeker has to feel that he is a river, and that the goal of the river is to flow the fastest and enter into the ocean. The seeker must recognise the necessity to enter into the Master. It should be with this kind of feeling that you fold your hands to meditate facing the disciples.

Tonight I selected some disciples who had good meditations. Do you think that I selected all those who had folded their hands during meditation? Far from it. There were only one or two who had folded their hands. There are many who have not folded their hands today whom I selected. Again there are many who were sitting in front of me folding their hands whom I did not select.

If you fold your hands soulfully, it will help you meditate better, but you don't have to do it at all. There are some who do not fold their hands soulfully, but only make their hands very stiff, as if they are going to press something together or break it. That kind of devotion is no devotion at all.

Some disciples feel as if they have one hundred dollars from their inner aspiration but their goal is one hundred and one. They need one dollar more in order to reach the destined goal. They feel that folding their hands helps because they know it may give them that last dollar they need to reach the goal. Others feel that they don't need to fold their hands. They feel that by increasing their aspiration they will automatically get the last dollar. They are right. But the first group feels that if there is something outwardly they can do which will immediately give them that one dollar more, they will do it.

Most fold their hands only when I turn towards them, and the rest of the time they do not fold their hands. There are some who are doing so not because I am looking at them, but because their inner being is telling them to fold their hands at that time. When I meditate on them, they feel that their aspiration has increased its intensity, it has now become greater, so they fold their hands. In this way they are doing it soulfully and spontaneously.

Otherwise, by folding your hands you can deceive yourself, you can deceive the friends around you for one day, two days, three days, two months or six months. Then your own sincerity will come forward. Something within you will pinch you and tell you either to fold your hands only when you are sincere and spiritual and when you feel it is necessary, or to stop folding your hands. Your own inner sincerity will enter you like a bullet and say you are deceiving yourself, you are deceiving others. But by deceiving, you are not getting real aspiration.

Again, just because you were folding your hands out of deception and now have realised your folly, that doesn't mean you should necessarily stop folding your hands. It is like curiosity. Some people enter into the spiritual life out of curiosity. They do not have sincere inspiration or aspiration, but out of curiosity they come to meetings and join the activities. Finally they see that their curiosity is getting them nowhere. The seekers around them have true aspiration, and they are gaining something inwardly and outwardly. At that time they want to stop their life of curiosity and they begin to sincerely aspire.

I often say that when you have to make a choice between idleness and ego, aggrandisement of ego is better than idleness. When you give importance to the ego, at least you start to do something. In the spiritual life also, if you fold your hands out of curiosity or even to show off, for two or three months you may do it. Then even if your own sincerity does not come forward, you may overhear two of your friends or enemies saying, "Oh, see what he does," and you will be embarrassed. If you are embarrassed, then you will stop it, or you will do it sincerely.

Today if you are waiting to get inspiration, or high aspiration, you don't have to fold your hands. When it comes from within, then you will fold your hands. That is absolutely the correct thing. If you are not getting aspiration for months and yet you fold your hands in a false way, somebody will come forward and criticise you. You will say, "How can he criticise me? It is beneath my dignity to be criticised by him or by her. Let me now do the right thing." To go through this process is one way to resolve the issue of folding hands. Of course, that is not the best way. The best way is to fold your hands only when it comes spontaneously from within.



* Question: Most disciples fold their hands when you are meditating and looking at them. But sometimes when I am meditating with you this doesn't come naturally. Is it all right not to fold our hands while you are looking at us?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:19
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Folding your hands should always be spontaneous. It should never be an outer show. It will be wrong if just as I look at you, you fold your hands and as soon as I look at the next person, you drop them. This is just like a mischievous boy. When the teacher comes, the clever student pretends to be working and as soon as the teacher looks to the other side, the student misbehaves. That is very bad. If I am looking at somebody else and then I turn to you, if you suddenly fold your hands and it is not spontaneous, then you are not getting anything from it.

But again, there are some disciples who are by nature very good, extremely devoted. They know that they cannot always remain in their highest, on the peak. They feel that when the Master looks at them, they get additional inner joy, thrill, confidence and enthusiasm. If there is anything they have not done which may further elevate their consciousness, then they will do it. They feel that if this outward gesture, folding their hands, is done soulfully, it definitely increases their aspiration.

In some instances you may even have a better meditation when I am looking at someone else than when I am looking at you. I may be looking at someone else who is receiving according to his capacity and receptivity. At that time, if you feel that you are in your highest consciousness and if you look at me, like a magnet you can pull my light. Although I am looking at somebody else, more of my light can be going to you than to him. On the other hand, while I am concentrating on you, perhaps you are thinking that all the other disciples are looking at you. Or your mind may be counting how many seconds I am looking at you and comparing this with how long I looked at others. So, if you fold your hands, it has to be spontaneous. If it is spontaneous, it adds to your aspiration. If it is not spontaneous, it is a useless outer gesture.

* Question: How can we tune in to the particular quality that you are bringing down most in your meditation?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:20
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Sometimes it is quite noticeable to the outer eye whether I am bringing down power or peace. Sometimes it is not, because while I am bringing down one aspect of divinity, such as peace, inside the peace there is also power or solid strength, or inside power there is peace. Again, sometimes everything comes but only one aspect is noticeable to the human eye.

Now, how will you identify yourself with the most prominent quality? Do not use the mind, do not use the eyes but inwardly become one with the quality. You have to use the heart to feel it, not the eyes to see it. You should keep your eyes open -- otherwise you may fall asleep-and use the heart to identify yourself with what you are seeing. If you see the beauty of a flower and enjoy its fragrance and you want to feel the essence of the flower inside your heart, you will not be able to feel it if you are only exercising the capacity of your nose and your eyes. Here you are not letting the heart exercise its capacity. You have seen and smelled the flower but you also have to grow into the flower which is full of beauty and purity. So, you are not the nose, you are not the eyes, you are the heart. The inner heart will immediately bring to the fore the essence and substance of the flower itself and you will become one with the flower. So, after you have seen a quality during your meditation, do not mentally say that it is power or delight. Just become that quality by using your heart.



* Question: Why should we keep our eyes open and look at you in meditation?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:21
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ If you look at me, my consciousness registers in your physical world. If you don't look at me, often you fall fast asleep and enter into the dream world. There you do something but you can't account for it. During conscious meditation, if you receive, then the mind is convinced and you feel something very sublime. When you dream, you get something but because its existence is in the inner world, you don't value it. I insist that people look at me from time to time because then my being registers in the mind. If you see the source, you know you are getting something. Otherwise, if you stand with your eyes closed in front of the ocean, you don't see or feel that you are receiving anything.



* Question: When we receive light and peace from our meditation, is it assimilated and stored for our gradual use, or do we constantly need it as we need food?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:22
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ You have to assimilate what you receive from meditation. If you do not assimilate these qualities, then it is almost useless. Then the next day you have to go again and get the same amount of peace, light and bliss. Once something is assimilated, it becomes a solid realisation, an absolutely permanent experience. Then it is not only a conscious part of you, but also inseparably one with your existence. This is very important. There is a great difference between when we assimilate our meditation and when we do not.

If peace, light and bliss are not assimilated, then it is as if a friend came into your life for a few hours and then he just left you after a short time. He did not become your eternal friend or your lifelong friend.

If you don't establish an eternal friendship, you do not give your friend the opportunity to be with you, to inspire you, to guide you, to mould you and shape you, or to share any divine qualities or capacities with you.



* Question: Is there any way to evaluate the result of our meditation?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:23
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Yes, there are two ways. One way is to ask the Master if the meditation has been really deep and profound. Sometimes it happens that when a seeker feels that he has had the highest meditation, it may not be true. At that time it is always advisable to ask the Master to evaluate one's meditation. If the Master is not available or if the Master is not in the physical, then the seeker has to evaluate the meditation in two ways. If the seeker feels enormous joy and compares this with the previous joy that he has felt when he has had a good meditation, and if the intensity of the joy far surpasses the previous intensity, then he has to feel that this time his meditation has gone higher.

The other way to evaluate one's meditation, which is absolutely the best way, is to see if, right after meditating, one feels totally detached from the joy itself. The seeker has to take the joy as an incident or an experience. No matter how deep or how shallow the meditation was, if he can detach himself totally from the joy or any divine quality he experienced and make his vessel, which we call receptivity, larger and deeper, then he is preparing himself for a higher and deeper experience. Whatever he has got is wonderful but he must not stay with the incident or experience that he received. If he can prepare himself for a higher journey, a higher experience, then that means he has gone one step higher through his meditation.



* Question: Is dedication the same thing as meditation?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:24
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ When you are giving something or helping people, that is not necessarily dedication. Dedication means feeling my conscious presence. While you are doing your work, if at that time you feel my conscious presence, that is called dedication. That kind of dedication is a form of meditation. But sometimes, because of your own ego, you want to help somebody -- you may feel that you have some capacity to inspire this person -- but you may not be able to see my presence inside him. At that time, you have to know that you are only aggrandising your ego by feeling that you have more inner wealth than the other person. But if you are doing something and, at the same time, if you are feeling my presence in the work itself, then that dedication is real meditation.



* Question: When people are sleeping during a very high meditation, do they receive anything?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:25
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Absolutely not. But if you just keep your eyes open and look at me, then naturally you are not sleeping. When you see something, you get inspiration. From inspiration you go to aspiration and from aspiration you go to realisation. Only when your eyes are closed are you enjoying sleep.



* Question: Why do I sometimes feel sad when I come out of meditation?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:26
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ When you meditate, please do not have any preconceived ideas. Do not think about whether you will receive pain or joy. Do not act like a beggar. Feel that you are doing the right thing, and when you come out of meditation, feel that that is the proper time for you to come out of meditation. When you are going high, higher, highest, there is no reason why you should doubt yourself. While you are climbing up a tree, if you know that you are climbing up a tree, you don't doubt the act of climbing. You are climbing a tree and you know that you are going high. When you are sure that you are climbing up high, higher, highest, then there is nothing to doubt.

When you come out of your meditation, if you feel sorry, then you have to feel that you are making a mistake. You want to remain up in the tree and eat the ripe mango to your heart's content. You don't want to bring it down and distribute it to mankind, to your brothers and sisters who are hungry.

So when you go up, you have to feel the necessity of going up to the highest to collect the mangoes and bringing them down. You are bringing them down and they are meant for distribution. But if you come down and you feel sad, that means you want to eat them all by yourself upstairs. You don't want to have to bring them down. You will act like an ordinary person in a very miserly way.

So the best thing is, when you go up, always to go with joy and when you come down, also to come down with joy. When you go up, feel that it is for achievement of the highest and when you come down or come out of meditation, feel that it is for distribution.THE HOUR OF MEDITATION



* Question: If we meditate in the evening or at other times during the day, is it as beneficial as meditating early in the morning?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:27
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Now, some of you meditate in the evening instead of in the morning. You say that in the evening your meditation is deep and profound. I don't deny it, only I wish to say that I believe the morning shows the day. Sometimes the morning may be cloudy and then afterwards the sun peeps out, but usually when the morning is clear, the whole day is bright. So if you start your spiritual life early in the morning, then you will go very fast. If you are very tired and exhausted because you have gone to bed late, my fervent request to each of you is to get up at your specific hour and meditate, and then go to bed again and make friends with sleep. But please meditate each morning regularly and punctually. Some of you meditate at lunch hour or in the office when you have a coffee break. That is excellent. But please do morning meditation also. Once you do the right thing early in the morning, then automatically you will be able to flow towards the sea like a river. Feel in the morning that you are a river. The very nature of a river is to flow and enter into the ocean. Here the ocean is the Supreme.

Now some disciples tell me that early in the morning it is very cold and they can't leave their bed and sit in front of the shrine. I sympathise with them, but what can I do? Such wonderful disciples I have-for various reasons they find it difficult to get up. To those disciples who said it was cold I said, "Please just sit on your bed; that is your shrine. Only do me a favour and just wash your eyes, your face and your nose; you don't have to take a proper shower. Then if you can put my picture in front of you while meditating, if you can look at my Transcendental picture, then that is enough. But please do not meditate while lying down. If you try to meditate while lying down, I will not be responsible for that meditation."

When one becomes a great spiritual Master, he has a kind of sleep called "yogic sleep." Even if my body appears to be asleep and everybody can hear me snoring from a distance, I will be able to prove to you later that I knew what was happening there in the room while I was asleep. When one realises God, he can do many things at a time. Once someone came into my room when I was sleeping. Later I told him, "I can tell you everything that happened. You stood in that corner, opened the window and so forth." I was snoring, but I was conscious at that time. Here I wish to say I can do many, many things at a time. But in your case, when you meditate, you have to be very careful and sit up and meditate. You don't want to sleep; you want to swim in the sea of light and delight.

To me, each seeker is a miracle because the same person could have stayed in ignorance. Out of countless people, you get up early in the morning and cry for God while your relatives and friends are still sleeping in the world of ignorance. If you are not the greatest miracle, who is? Out of billions of people in the world, you want to realise God and you get up and pray. You could have easily joined your friends or neighbours who are still sleeping, but you have got up to pray and meditate.



* Question: Recently we were meditating four or five times a day. Has the effort of doing this caused any general improvement in our consciousness during the day?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:28
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Some disciples have made considerable progress. The power you have developed, the capacity you have developed can be used tomorrow for God-realisation. Now it is being used for God-manifestation. Once we establish more receptivity in meditation by practice, the physical also gets more strength. Then tomorrow we can do something else with the strength we have accumulated.

Some of you have been meditating four times a day. Out of a half hour session some of you have meditated well for, say, ten minutes, and out of a total of two hours during the day, you may have meditated extremely well for half an hour. Previously you meditated only half an hour for your God-realisation. Out of half an hour perhaps you have meditated well for only two minutes because you found that sleep did not leave you. Here you are meditating many times a day and each time you meditate well, you develop some capacity. This capacity you are using now for a special purpose. This capacity does not go away. At another time when you have another goal to achieve, you can use this capacity which you have acquired. Instead of meditating for God-manifestation, you can meditate not for any special purpose, but to become an absolutely perfect instrument of the Supreme.

So, the power that you have acquired to sit and meditate can and must be utilised for different things. If you did not acquire that capacity, naturally you would not be able to use it. Some of you have really acquired capacity, developed some inner muscles. You are not meditating mechanically; there is some inner vision.



* Question: Should we try to get up spontaneously to meditate or should we set an alarm?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:29
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ You should use an alarm. Otherwise, you have to become a Yogi to get the special Grace to wake you up. But please, when you meditate, do not keep a watch in front of you at every second. Some students may have this tendency, because they know they have to get ready to go to school. But if you really want to meditate soulfully, just dive deep within. True, you are not entering into Nirvana, but when you meditate, you are pleasing the Supreme. He will make you conscious of the fact that it is time to go to school. If you are really meditating, He will do this. But if you are in the fairyland, dreaming, wasting your precious time, it will not be His responsibility.



* Question: Is it bad for someone to go back to sleep after meditating from two to three in the morning?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:30
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ No, it is not bad at all. If you have to sleep after meditation you can go to sleep, but if you can continue meditating from two to five without going back to sleep, that is infinitely better. But if that is not possible for you right now, if you can meditate for an hour, then the result of your meditation you can assimilate after your meditation.

The only difficulty is that if you meditate from two to three or four o'clock, then afterwards there will be quite a few hours before you get up. If you get up at nine or ten o'clock, just because you meditated at two o'clock, then between seven and eight the vital forces -- your own vital forces or the aggression of the earth which is agitated at seven or eight o'clock -- will cause your consciousness to become agitated. The agitation from the earth's consciousness or from your own lower vital can enter into the results of the meditation which you did at two o'clock or three o'clock. So after your meditation, either you have to have a very peaceful sleep or you have to get up again at five or six o'clock. If you get up at nine o'clock or ten o'clock, just because you meditated at three o'clock, then the agitation and the hustle and bustle of life around you can disturb you totally.

So you have to be very careful. For an hour or so, from two to three, you can meditate and then you can sleep again from three to five. But please be awake by six o'clock. Otherwise the consciousness of the earth, which becomes awakened and agitated at that time, can create a disturbance in your consciousness.



* Question: Once you said that if we concentrated on an idea for half an hour, it would work miracles.

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:31
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ In the morning, if you are really concentrating well on a particular idea, then the idea itself has strength and power in it. But afterwards you have to execute it. If you do not try to execute it, then it will die. It is like a beautiful flower. Immediately you have to place it on the altar; otherwise, the flower will only wither and die. Each thought is a type of flower. After a few hours, it will lose all its beauty and fragrance.



* Question: If during your meditation you feel comfortable and really inspired, can you increase your meditation time?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:32
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ For the time being just remain in a meditative mood and read spiritual writings or sing devotional songs. If you have been meditating for one hour, then after two or three months you can increase the length of time, but do not increase it suddenly. Even if you are inspired, please increase your meditation time by degrees. Otherwise, if today you meditate well and you meditate for another hour, then in a subtle way pride enters. Pride is your worst enemy. You will be bloated with pride the whole day, and then the following day this pride will not allow you to meditate at all. You will think that you have got everything from your meditation, so for two weeks you won't get up. Meditation is just like eating. No matter how much you eat today, tomorrow again you have to eat to get energy. So do not overeat. Please go slowly. If you have to, increase your time only by two or three minutes. Then after a month or so you can increase it ten or fifteen minutes.



* Question: If we start at the same time, can we meditate one day for half an hour and another day for an hour?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:33
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ No, do not jump from half an hour to one hour. Continue for one month, two months or three months meditating for the same length of time. Otherwise one day you will meditate for half an hour more and the next day you may not meditate even for one second. So it is like eating or taking exercise. One day you will eat too much and the next day you will have stomach problems. Or if you have the capacity to do five push-ups and then one day you get inspired and do twenty, the following day you won't even be able to go to the gym because your arms will feel broken; they will be full of pain. So always increase your capacity slowly; then you will have no difficulty.



* Question: If you set a time for your meditation and are able to get up earlier, should you still keep your time?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:34
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Yes, this time is important because that is the hour that you have fixed. If your time to meditate is 4:30 in the morning, at that hour your soul will knock at your door -- like a punctual newspaper boy -- so you had better be prepared. Choose the time that you feel is best and stick to it. The best time for you people is some time after 4:30 am. Yesterday you may have meditated at four o'clock, another day at two o'clock, another day at five o'clock, some days even at nine o'clock -- but is it real meditation? At two o'clock in the morning or any time before 4:30, it is not possible for you to meditate well, because you will be tired. So disciples should get up and meditate between the hours of 4:30 am and 6:45 am. After seven o'clock I know the consciousness of America: it is in a hustle and bustle mood.

Please meditate at the time you are supposed to. If you change your time every day or if you have not meditated, I will catch you people in the inner worlds, because I have realised God and you have not. So please become like an Indian farmer and plough your fields, your meditation fields, every day at the same hour.



* Question: Is it good to get up earlier than our appointed meditation time so that we can shower and get ready?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:35
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ You can get up half an hour earlier in order to shower and get ready, but then you must start to meditate at your appointed time. Sometimes it is good to read my writings for a few minutes or sing some spiritual songs to prepare yourself inwardly.



* Question: If we are sleepy, is it all right to exercise?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:36
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Certainly. Some disciples do headstands. It is very good to do headstands or two or three minutes of asanas, Hatha Yoga exercises; only don't do them for two or three hours. A few minutes will be enough.



* Question: After five minutes of meditation I feel tired.

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:37
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ When you were working at our gallery, no matter how tired you were, if I asked you to get me something to drink, you just ran. Why? There are two reasons. One is that people were there to appreciate you if you did the thing, and because you wanted appreciation, you did it. The other reason is that you felt the inner need to do it. If you remain in the physical and vital, you do something because people will appreciate you. But if you remain on the soul's level, then you will do it out of inner devotion, inner need.

If I spend four hours playing volleyball, then I will develop some capacity; but that capacity I cannot apply to ping-pong. So try to develop some capacity to meditate in the same way that you have developed the capacity to do other things.



* Question: What purpose do you have in offering a seven-hour meditation?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:38
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ The purpose is nothing but self-dedicated service. I am executing an inner command from my Inner Pilot. He wants to offer a seven-hour meditation to the aspiring public and He feels that there will be some people who will derive spiritual benefit from it.



* Question: Why do you hold such a long meditation?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: HM:39
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ From the highest spiritual point of view there is no outer explanation. Most of the people who will come, I feel, will not be truly advanced seekers. It is only that I am executing the Supreme's command. But on the physical plane and on the mental plane I can say that some people can meditate for only five minutes when they try to meditate for, say, an hour. If these people were asked to meditate only for five minutes, then they would not be able to meditate at all. So during these seven hours, instead of only five minutes, some people will have all together an hour or forty-five minutes of deep meditation.
