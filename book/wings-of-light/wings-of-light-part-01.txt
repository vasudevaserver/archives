#+BEGIN_VERSE

From my daily visit with God
I learn one thing:
Surrender unconditional.
First He asks me to do something,
And then He does it for me.

From my daily visit with man
I learn three things:
Depression constant,
Frustration immediate,
Destruction total.
First man gives me
His possessions,
And then he claims them again
As his own.

Others' good qualities
And ignores his own bad qualities.

Perfect, let alone his Master.

A serious mistake
In accepting the spiritual life.
