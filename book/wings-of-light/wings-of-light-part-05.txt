#+BEGIN_VERSE

O my soul,
I wrote to you
For help
In my God-manifestation.
Alas,
Your answer could have been
More generous.

O my heart,
I wrote to you
For help
In my God-manifestation.
Alas,
Your poor response
Fails to inspire me.

O my mind,
I wrote to you
For help
In my God-manifestation.
Alas,
Your obscure answer
Puzzles me.

O my vital,
I wrote to you
For help
In my God-manifestation.
Alas,
Your senseless answer
Frustrates me.

O my body,
I didn't write to you
Because
I didn't know
Whom to choose
Between you
And ignorance.
