No man can ever have a daughter
Who always thinks of her father's height.

No woman can ever have a daughter
Who always thinks of her mother's light.

Who always feels its excruciating pangs.

No truth can ever have a daughter
Who always adores its inevitable victory.

O soul, you and I
Have come into the world
To speak of God.

Wants to hear us,
Let us talk
About ourselves.
O soul, I think that
Without God's guidance
I can teach His world.
"O seeker, I think that
I can manifest God
Without your assistance."

The saint was about to fall
When he saw not the Face of God

When he sang the song
Of life-transforming Light.

I shall invite you
To offer me your wise
Advice,
Without fail.
