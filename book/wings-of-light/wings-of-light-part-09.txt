Who is God?

Of self-transcendence
At each hush-gap.

I played with Eternity the other day.
Neither Eternity nor I won the game,
Neither Eternity nor I lost the game.

I sang with Infinity the other night.
Indeed, we two are the singers
Of the transcendental Heights.

I danced with Immortality the other day.
At the end we bartered our lives.

I walked with God the other night.
When He felt tired, I carried Him along
On my shoulders.
When I felt tired, He carried me along
Inside His Heart.
