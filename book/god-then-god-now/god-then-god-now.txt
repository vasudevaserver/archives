I ask my Lord Supreme, I ask:
What is my task, what is my task?
"My child, try and cry to change thy face
And tell the world My Name is Grace."
Shall I succeed, can I succeed?
"Why not, why not? My Breath shall feed
Your life of love, devotion pure
Victory all-where when surrender sure."

O time and space,
I need you not.
My breath has caught
My Supreme's Face.
O depth and height,
I need you not.
My soul has bought
Reality's light.
O Golden Goal,
I need you not.
My Lord has sought
My journey's soul.

Awake, O Mother Ind, awake!
To burn the Spirit's fire
In the heart of the mortal's mire
Where flowers of new dawn shall break.

To save the dying earth
With the flood of nectar-birth
And stop the age-long dance of the snake.

Alas, nowhere I see my goal.
Yet I have a soul, I have a soul.

Soul-stirring eyes of gold-delight,
All-where reigning supreme
Our blind secrecy's dream
She seizes with her all-forgiving sight.
Torn now asunder our ego's screen
Under her smile of grace
Blooms quick our surrender's face
She paves the way to a life evergreen.

O Beloved, O Beloved
O Lover, Lover sweet
We shall shine, we shall shine
Through Eternity.
