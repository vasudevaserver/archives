Brother Jesus,
Where are you?
"Why?
Am I not on earth?"
No, you are not.

Brother Jesus,
Where are you?
"Why?
Am I not in Heaven?"
No, you are not.
"Where do you think
Then, I am?"
I do not know.

"Brother C,
The beauty of
Your self-chosen ignorance-eye
I am deeply enjoying.
But mind you,
I am not going to treasure it.
Never!"

The world needs you.
"No, it does not."

"It does not need anybody.
No, not even our Father.
It needs only one thing:
Eternity's ignorance-feast."

Brother Jesus,
Were you really born
On December 25th,
Two thousand years ago?
"I think so.
I am not sure."
How is it
That you are not sure
Of the date of your birth?
"Brother C,
Why should I pay any attention
To the world
That failed to care for me,
To the world
That failed to accept me,
To the world
That succeeded only in crucifying me?"

Brother Jesus,
How do you like the fact
That the world is appreciating you today
Unreservedly and unconditionally?
"Yes, brother C,
I should be satisfied
With the world's appreciation-meal at least.
But I am sure you know
That what I really want
Is action-salvation
And
Action-feast."

Are growing within me unerringly.

The true truth by this time:
This self-chosen ignorance
Is sometimes
A flood of nectar-bliss "

Brother Jesus,
How many churches
Have you already visited tonight?
"Brother C,
Since two thousand years ago
I left the earth-scene
I have completely forgotten
Earth-calculation.
Will you condescend
To count on my behalf?"
Certainly I shall do it for you.
But are you going to understand
My earth-figures
When I take the trouble
Of counting the places
You have visited
Or are going to visit today?
"Brother C,
You will fail,
You are bound to fail.
But for our Father's sake
Keep it a top secret.
Only let /me/ know, please."
Why only you, dearest brother?
"Because."
Why? Why?
"Because, because."
Why? Why? Why?
"Because. Because. Because."

"Brother C,
Tell me, how is everything
On earth?"
Earth is crying.
Do you know why?
"No, I do not,"
Earth is crying
Because
All its protests
Against its transformation-life
Are ending in vain.
Brother, this is why
Earth is suffering
And, as you know,
Its suffering will never come to an end.
Before, only earth's heart
Was frightened
By brooding ignorance-night.
Now, earth's entire body-life
Is frightened to death
By illumining-consciousness-light.

In and through your children
Will suffer Eternity's endless delay."

stupidity.
They are adoring me
On your birthday.

You know well when I
Can and will really be born:
That will be the day
When earth receives
Our Father's Light from you.
And I am truly proud
Of your children sweet and cute.

Father's one endless ascending Cry
On earth;
Father's one endless descending Smile

Brother Jesus,
My last question:
I shall be extremely grateful
To you
And I shall be extremely proud
Of you
If you tell me
When you are coming back
To earth.
"Brother C,
Your Himalayan question arrow
You have hurled at the wrong person.
Only our Father can answer
Your stupid-proud
Query.
By the way, even yesterday
Father told me categorically
That He will never grant me
Even a short vacation
To enjoy on earth.
So you see, what can I do?
Poor me, brother C."
Poorer me, brother Jesus.

You know our old Father."

Brother Jesus,
Will you do me a big favour?
"Certainly I shall."
Please tell our Father
That of late I have been
Thinking of Him constantly.
"Brother C,
I give you my word of honour,
The moment I go back
And sit at Father's Feet
I shall offer Him
Your message.
Don't you worry.
Brother C,
It is getting late.
I must not cause
Any unnecessary worry
For our poor old Father."
Brother Jesus,
I perfectly understand that.
Go, go back to our lucky Father.
Let me stay,
Commissioned if not compelled,
With our unlucky Mother.

Have asked me to use another weapon:

True Masters of all ages have respected one another's teachings and admired one another's spiritual achievements. Each subsequent Master offers a new impetus to earth-awakening, earth-transformation and earth-perfection, being constantly conscious of his source of Light and Life: the Absolute Supreme. Far from being inner rivals, they are loving and devoted brothers. In this small volume Sri Chinmoy reveals his intimate inner connection with his brother the Christ through poems, aphorisms and dramatic dialogues.
