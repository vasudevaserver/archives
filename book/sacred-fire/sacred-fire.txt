/(The Abode of the ever-transcending Heights. The Absolute and the World-soul are having a conversation.)/

/World-soul:/ Father, Lord, Beloved, my All. What is wrong with You? I have always seen You as infinite Delight. You have always been the Source and Flow of boundless Delight. Today I notice blighted sorrow and chilled depression on Your Face. I beg of You a thousand times not to torment my heart's inseparable oneness with Your Universal Heart.

/Absolute:/ Stop, stop, you culprit!

/World-soul:/ Father, my Lord, Beloved, am I the culprit? May I know what I have done?

/Absolute:/ Go deep within You and your daughter will immediately realise what you have done.

/World-soul:/ My daughter, too? She is also a culprit?

/Absolute:/ She is a worse culprit!

/World-soul:/ But Father, You have blessed me out of Your infinite Bounty with a number of daughters. Like me, which one has wronged You?

/Absolute:/ I tell you, the term 'wronged' is a shameless understatement. You and your England-daughter!

/World-soul:/ What have we done?

/Absolute:/ What have you /not/ done? And I tell you, one more person is involved. Do you want to know who she is?

/World-soul:/ Yes, Lord, I do want to know.

/Absolute:/ She is your grand-daughter, America. Your daughter and your grand-daughter are constantly fighting, and most ruthlessly. Look what they have done! They have killed My Heart of Joy. They have killed all My unhorizoned inspiration. They are destroying My Vision's new creation. And you, you fool, you have done nothing!

/World-soul:/ Father, I am not a fool. I am just weak.

/Absolute:/ You are not only weak but also stupid! During the day you swim in the sea of stupidity and during the night you swim in the sea of weakness. You can't even control your own daughter and your grand-daughter. What prevents you from throwing some illumining light on them?

/World-soul:/ Father, I have tried. I am still trying. But neither of them is ready to listen to me. They are eager to fight and kill each other. Lord, I am helpless.

/Absolute:/ You are not helpless. You are useless, that's all. Listen, tomorrow at 5:00 a.m. sharp I want you and your daughter and her daughter here.

/World-soul:/ Father, You have saved me. /(Clasping His Feet.)/

/Absolute:/ Not yet, you mountain-high fool, you sea-deep coward. Don't forget to come tomorrow!

/World-soul:/ Father, I assure You tomorrow my daughter England, my grand-daughter America and I shall come without fail and place ourselves at Your all-fulfilling Feet.

/Absolute./ Okay, okay.

/(The World-soul, the soul of England and the soul of America are seated at the Feet of the Absolute.)/ /Absolute:/ World-soul, My daughter, yesterday I was cross with you, but today I have forgiven you. Do you know why?

/World-soul:/ Father, I do not have to know why. Since You have forgiven me, my heart is all gratitude to You.

/Absolute:/ No, no, let Me tell you why I have forgiven you. I am so moved by your daughter's exquisite beauty and I am so fascinated by your grand-daughter's indomitable strength.

/World-soul:/ Father, it is true; my daughter has exquisite beauty, my granddaughter has indomitable strength. Now, may I be allowed to say what I have? I have fathomless ignorance.

/Absolute:/ Daughter, I do not want to remain bound to My yesterday's invention. From there I have moved to today's discovery. Your daughter is extremely beautiful, your grand-daughter is extremely powerful and you are extremely fruitful. Now, My sweet England, why are you not allowing your daughter America to go in her own way? She feels that she is mature enough to take care of herself. Let her try.

/World-soul:/ Father, that is exactly what I have been telling my daughter all along. But she has turned a deaf ear to my advice.

/Soul of America:/ Grandmother, I too have been telling my mother the same thing. But she simply won't listen to me. I wish to tell You, my Lord, and you, my grandmother, that there is a reason why my mother is not allowing me to be free. She is terribly jealous of me, of my capacity.

/Soul of England:/ No, I am not! America, don't brag. A war between us is imminent. Then you will see that you will be nowhere You are bound to kiss the dust of my feet.

/Soul of America:/ Mother, the joy of victory and the sorrow of defeat are in the Hands of the Absolute Lord. He will give you what you deserve and He will give me what I deserve.

/(A sweet smile flashes across the Face of the Absolute.)/

/Soul of England:/ America, enough, enough! You do not have to bless me with your divine philosophy. You stay with your philosophy. A philosopher is one whose mind is fertile and arms are futile. Fruitless vision is your name, whereas my name is fruitful action.

/Soul of America:/ Mother, the Lord will decide your fate and mine. Why worry now?

/Soul of England:/ For God's sake, I am not worried in the least! Let me remind you of one thing. The Lord has taught His creation that only the brave deserve the fair. I am sure you have got the point.

/Soul of America:/ Mother, I have.

/Absolute:/ I am an old man. What both of you have been discussing is far beyond My comprehension. But England, My sweet England, I tell you the supreme truth: there is a beauty in the rising sun and there is a beauty in the setting sun. Both equally charming, illumining and fulfilling. You have so far enjoyed the beauty of the rising sun, but from now on you will have to enjoy the beauty of the setting sun. And you, My brave America, before long you shall start enjoying the beauty of the rising sun-the sun that illumines, the sun that liberates, the sun that immortalises the soul and the body of aspiring humanity. England and America, I tell you one thing: My Heart's desire is an amicable settlement between you both.

/Soul of America:/ Lord, my dearest and bravest son George Washington also desires that very thing. But alas, as You know, it has now become a hopeless case. Mother wants to maintain her supremacy. And we do not want that; therefore, the only thing for us to do is to fight it out.

/Absolute:/ Well, I am telling both of you something extremely important. And I want my daughter World-soul to pay all attention to what I am saying, too. England and America, mother and daughter, you two have been quarrelling and fighting and strangling each other. But there shall come a day when you will change your relationship. Instead of remaining mother and daughter, instead of remaining bitter foes you will become loving comrades and illumining and fulfilling souls.

/World-soul:/ Father, Father, my heart is eagerly awaiting that golden day. I am counting the hours, nay, the minutes! Lord, I wish to offer You a soulful song.

/Absolute:/ Ah, that is what My Heart needs.

/(World-soul sings:/

#+BEGIN_VERSE

There is no rhyme for my Lord save Love.
There is no rhyme for my life save Power.
I know, I know, yet dare I not
Smash asunder my ignorance-Tower.

#+END_VERSE

/Absolute:/ Marvellous, marvellous, marvellous! I am so proud of you. Once upon a time, when you were a little child, I used to teach you singing. Needless to say, Daughter, you have far surpassed your Father. But I am happy to accept defeat at the hands of My own daughter.

/World-soul:/ Father, sometimes I forget that You are infinite. Yesterday You assumed one aspect to threaten and frighten me and today You have assumed another aspect to inundate my entire existence with Your immortalising Love.

/Absolute:/ True, My daughter, true.

/Soul of England:/ Lord, Grandfather, I too wish to offer You a beautiful song. I envy my mother. She was divinely lucky to have You as her music Teacher. Many times I have heard her singing songs which were taught her by You. I don't deny that she has a very good singing voice. In fact, I must say that I am no match for her.

/Absolute:/ Sweet England, I am sure that you, too, have an excellent voice. Sing! Let me hear you, please.

/(Soul of England sings:/

#+BEGIN_VERSE

Into the world of beauty's flame,
Into the world of offering's game,
Into the world of lustre-flood,
I came, I came, my existence came.

#+END_VERSE

/Absolute:/ Beautiful, marvellous, wonderful! You liar, why did you underestimate your singing ability? You are an excellent singer.

/Soul of America:/ Lord, my mother and my grandmother are really good singers. Unfortunately, I can't sing at all.

/World-soul:/ Don't display your false modesty.

/Soul of England:/ We don't appreciate your false modesty.

/Soul of America:/ Lord, do believe me, I am not a singer. But may I dance instead of singing for You?

/Absolute:/ Of course, of course. That is a good idea. My bravest child, dance for Me. Nothing will please Me more.

/(Soul of America dances.)/

/Absolute:/ Incredible, incredible! I have never seen in all My existence such a beautiful dance. America, My bravest child, and by far the best dancer, if I were young I would have definitely joined you. With greatest difficulty I am resisting temptation.

/(The Absolute, World-soul and the soul of England give a thunderous applause.)/

/(George Washington and his mother, Mary Ball Washington, at home.)/

/George Washington:/ Mother, Mother, my heart is all gratitude to you. It was you who did not allow me to join His Majesty's Navy when I was quite young-hardly fourteen. I need not tell you, Mother, that your son and loyalty are inseparable. And who gave me this most precious sense of loyalty? You, Mother, only you. As a result, I am able to dedicate myself completely to the cause of American independence.

/Mary Washington:/ My son, you think and feel that you and loyalty are inseparable. But another name for my son George is modesty. You are your country's top-ranking general. You and you alone are America's supreme need and divine choice to lead your country to victory! You will seat your country on the throne of victory and place the victory-crown upon its head.

/George Washington:/ Mother, your son loves only one thing on earth.

/Mary Washington:/ What is that, my son?

/George Washington:/ Peace. Peace in our country, peace in Great Britain, peace throughout the world.

/Mary Washington:/ My son, although you are only twenty-seven, your country has chosen you as its supreme hero to command all the military forces of the colonies. George, you have two other names: loyalty and modesty. But did you know that I also have another name?

/George Washington:/ What is it, Mother?

/Mary Washington:/ Pride, my son, pride in you. You are at once my pride and your country's pride unparalleled.

/George Washington:/ My countrymen think that I am a patriot to the core. Alas, I do not dare to tell them that although I like patriotism, I love peace. My heart is being ruthlessly tormented by the mere thought of breaking with our mother country so violently. True, I definitely want freedom, but I want this freedom in a peaceful way.

/Mary Washington:/ Son, that is not to be. No, you will have to fight against Great Britain, for that is the only way. I believe this is a God-ordained war. It is you who have to offer your country the smile of victory, freedom-dawn. Hunger, you and your soldiers will brave. Cold, you and your soldiers will brave. Countless dear ones you and your soldiers will lose. Frequent defeats you are fated to suffer. But there will come a time when victory's sun will shine on the life and soul of America. And that sun will bless you, embrace you and treasure you.

/George Washington:/ Mother, you think too highly of me.

/Mary Washington:/ Son, it is not a matter of thinking. I see the truth I tell the truth. You know that your mother has always been a perfect stranger to falsehood.

/George Washington:/ I don't deny that you and sincerity are bosom friends, But your prophetic words frighten me far beyond your imagination.

/Mary Washington:/ I do not care for imagination. You must not think that what I am saying is a mere figment of my imagination. This is not imagination, but my glowing realisation. Yours is the inevitable victory. You will be the father of this country. As your mother, I wish to bless you, my son. As your future daughter, I would like to be blessed by you.

/(Mary comes over to him.)/

/George Washington:/ Mother /(dropping down on his knees),/ I need your blessing to win this war. You are still my mother. Let victory dawn; then, future daughter, I shall dare to bless you. /(Mary blesses him.)/ Mother, you are very kind.

/Mary Washington:/ Son, you are very great, and good, too.

/George Washington:/ Mother, who is my source, whose vision is in me? Who is the confidence-power in me? You and you alone! And whose blessing light shall carry me to victory's golden shore? Yours and yours alone!

/(Several years later. Night. George Washington's elder half-brother, Lawrence, who died many years before, appears before his younger brother in a dream.)/

Lawrence: George, I am sorry to ruin your sleep. I am sure you went to bed at nine o'clock as usual. You have hardly slept two hours. George, I am so proud of you. I am so proud of you. I am so proud of you. I salute the indomitable spirit of the General in you. I bow to the peerless wisdom of the President in you. I take endless pride in the Father of the Nation in you. George, I have come to you to cheer you up. Don't be sad. While I was on earth, you and I were extremely fond of each other. On the strength of our mutual fondness, I have come to tell you something special. I have known you from your very birth, George. You have always been a true lover of peace. You have always valued peace infinitely more than anything else. Our country needed you to fight for her. Our country needed you to liberate her from bondage-night. You surrendered your own will to our country's will; therefore, my pride in you knows no bounds. Under your supreme leadership our country has won the war. For many long years you have struggled far beyond any human imagination; therefore, I know how richly you deserve some rest. But our country needs you again. This time it needs you desperately to build an undivided nation. Our country needs your guidance inimitable. I assure you, George, that you will be the first and last president to be everybody's choice. Many will succeed you, but you, with your lofty ideals, will be their pole star. You will be their guiding hand. George, your dear brother Lawrence urges you to accept the presidency. Heed not your will, brother, but our country's will.

/George Washington:/ O brother of my heart and soul, it is true that I commanded the whole American army, but today I gladly take your wish as a supreme command. Brother Lawrence, to please you is to please the real in me. I am definitely willing to become the President of America.

/Lawrence:/ I am most grateful to you. The entire nation will be grateful to you. I am truly proud of you, as the entire nation will be proud of you, George. Let me tell you something really sweet. Your young friend and greatest admirer, Henry Lee, will say something to the whole nation after you have left the body. His loftiest message will be echoed and re-echoed from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Nay, the whole world will admire his supreme discovery. Don't get excited, George. Of course, it is very easy to give advice; my own excitement is running riot. But this young friend of yours will declare, five days after paying his last respects to your deceased body, that you were first in war, first in peace and first in the hearts of your countrymen.

/George Washington:/ How do you know that?

/Lawrence:/ Brother George, I live in Heaven. One can see and know everything from here. I am like someone who is at the top of the tree, who clearly sees and knows what is happening or what is going to happen all around the foot of the tree. Brother, Heaven is all vision, and I am enjoying this divine vision. Earth, where you are, is all mission. You are struggling, sometimes consciously and sometimes unconsciously, and you will be struggling surprisingly hard to fulfil your God-ordained supreme mission. George, you know perfectly well that I have never been a singer. But, to my genuine surprise, and no doubt yours, I have set a tune to Henry Lee's transcendental utterance.

/(Lawrence sings, "First in war, first an peace, first in the hearts of his countrymen.")/

/George Washington:/ Excellent, Lawrence! You are an excellent singer.

/Lawrence:/ Thanks a lot, George. But it is getting rather late. I must go back to Heaven now.

/George Washington:/ Oh no, please stay with me a little longer.

/Lawrence:/ George, I always get the greatest joy by pleasing you.

/George Washington:/ And I, by pleasing you. Tell me, when are you going to come back again to encourage me, inspire me and elevate me?

/Lawrence./ I shall definitely come as soon as I can. I shall definitely come as often as I can. But I tell you one thing, a top secret. Don't disclose it to anyone. I shall come to you for the last time on December 14, 1799. At that time I shall come to you to bring you to my home, where I am living now.

/George Washington:/ Really? Lawrence, don't forget that significant day. I shall be eagerly expecting you. I tell you, Lawrence, I don't have the slightest desire to be thought of as the Father of the Nation. My grateful life and my soulful heart desire only to remain your eternal brother.

/Lawrence:/ I, too, want that. I, too, want to remain your eternal brother. I am sure the Almighty will grant our prayer.

/(George Washington is admiring the beauty of one of his farms.)/

/George Washington:/ Indeed, England was right. The English said that we are not in a position to rule our country. Look how my countrymen are angrily and endlessly fighting over absolutely unimportant things. Each one treasures his own ideas as flawless and perfect jewels. To me, all of their ideas are nothing but ridiculous idiosyncrasies. England is mocking us. Although we have won the war for independence, the British are making fun of us. We must immediately put an end to it. And also, we must shatter England's idea of the supreme necessity for a king. We don't need a king. Of late, out of their tremendous love and respect for me, my countrymen have started calling me King. But no, I reject this honour! Have I not fought against the injustice of the King of England? Why enter into the same ridiculous position? No, it is beneath our country's dignity to follow in the footsteps of England. In England people become scared to death at the very mention of the King's name. They think that to defy the King's authority is the worst possible crime. They are not afraid of bullets and death. They are afraid only of His Majesty's supreme authority, nay, autocracy. Look at the height of their stupendous stupidity! They sincerely believe that their King was chosen by God Himself. As if God has nothing else to do either in Heaven or on earth! And even after touching the highest height of stupidity, still they are not satisfied. They think that to disobey the King is to disobey God. O Almighty One, if You have time, forgive their stupidity. If You have more time, illumine their minds so that they do not fall helplessly into the sea of stupidity any more. The King is a man, a mortal like me. He can never be infallible. Why worship a king who is as prone to committing mistakes as any other ordinary human being?

/(Enter Thomas Jefferson.)/

/Thomas Jefferson:/ Sir, I have brought your song. I do hope that you will be satisfied with my tune.

/George Washington:/ I am sure you have done a good job. Jefferson, I have two more names for you: excellence and perfection.

/Thomas Jefferson:/ I shall eternally remain grateful to you for offering me these two most precious names. But it is you alone who are entitled to these names: excellence and perfection.

/George Washington:/ All right, let us share our excellence and perfection.

/Thomas Jefferson:/ That is a splendid idea. Let us do that. Now, here is your song.

/(Thomas Jefferson sings, accompanying himself on the violin. Then, he and George Washington sing together.)/

/George Washington:/ Dear Jefferson!

/Thomas Jefferson:/ Sir Washington!

/George Washington:/ All-where your wings of capacity fly.

/Thomas Jefferson:/ You are the sun-vast pride of your banner high.

/George Washington:/ You are our America's peerless brain.

/Thomas Jefferson:/ You freed us from bondage-chain.

/George Washington:/ In your mind is our country's vision-light.

/Thomas Jefferson:/ Your shoulders, our country's mission-height.

/George Washington:/ You have told us no more dark night.

/Thomas Jefferson:/ You have given us nectar-delight.

/George Washington:/ Marvellous!

/Thomas Jefferson:/ Now, let me teach it to you.

/George Washington:/ You know that God has not granted me a singing voice.

/Thomas Jefferson:/ Sir, I do not subscribe to your conviction. Unless you have tried, how can you know? Please sing with me. I am sure you will also excel in music, as you excel in everything else.

/George Washington:/ Helpless, I am surrendering to your clever and inescapable encouragement. Let me try. Teach me how to sing.

/Thomas Jefferson:/ I am teaching you with great pleasure and honour.

/(Thomas Jefferson and George Washington sing together. Washington carries the tune perfectly.)/

/Thomas Jefferson:/ You see, sir, I was right.

/George Washington:/ You were an inventor. Today, you have become a discoverer-the discoverer of a singer in me.

/Thomas Jefferson:/ Let us each sing our respective lines.

/George Washington:/ That is a nice idea. Let us do that. /(They sing.)/ All glory to you, Jefferson! I was a soldier, but you have turned me into a singer. Look at your capacity-height and my gratitude-light.

/Thomas Jefferson:/ Sir, you are our country's constant pride, in everything that you do and say.

/George Washington:/ I thank you, Jefferson, from the depth of my heart. Now, if you don't mind, may I change the subject?

/Thomas Jefferson:/ Of course. To please you is to please myself.

/George Washington:/ If that is so, then right from today I want you and Alexander Hamilton to work together peacefully. I have chosen both of you to be my two strong shoulders. Alas, my shoulders are causing me endless worries.

/Thomas Jefferson:/ Forgive me, sir. I know Hamilton and I are two real culprits. We create constant troubles for you. Sometimes, even when we see and know that the other party is perfectly right, we find it difficult to admit it outwardly. Such is our unpardonable weakness. But, on my part, I shall try my utmost to work with Hamilton peacefully from now on. It was kind of you to bless us by calling us your two shoulders.

/George Washington:/ Not mere shoulders, but my giant shoulders. Jefferson, it is you who have written our Declaration of Independence. There you have said something truly precious to my heart and soul. You said that we derive our just powers from the consent of the governed and not otherwise. A gift of immortal glory you have offered to our country. Your matchless mind is all illumination. If you do not come forward and put an end to the constant sad dispute between yourself and Hamilton, who will and who can? It was with great joy and pride that I made you Secretary of State and Hamilton Secretary of the Treasury. Both of you are more than qualified in your respective fields. But alas, I do not know what prevents you two from working together peacefully.

/Thomas Jefferson:/ I am sure you know what prevents us from working together. It is our unlit jealousy. It is our disproportionate sense of supremacy.

/George Washington:/ Your diamond sincerity, Jefferson, deserves all my heart's unalloyed admiration. Now, please tell me if I have understood your point of view and Hamilton's point of view. At your journey's start both of you had the same notion: that some people have more wisdom and more honesty than others. Am I correct?

/Thomas Jefferson:/ Yes, you are perfectly correct.

/George Washington:/ But you feel that these wise and honest people are as likely to be found in one class as another, whereas Hamilton thinks these people are more likely to be found among well-educated, well-established and successful men, rather than among the other classes.

/Thomas Jefferson:/ True, sir.

/George Washington:/ To me the difference is very small, almost negligible. Both of you are making a mountain out of a molehill. You two can easily reconcile your points of view in the twinkling of an eye, if you want to.

/Thomas Jefferson:/ We know that. But our ego-ignorance still lords it over us.

/George Washington:/ Ignorance-life does not become you, especially in your position of responsibility and leadership. So, my dear brother, please try for an immediate reconciliation.

/Thomas Jefferson:/ I shall. I give you my word of honour, sir.

/(John Adams is conversing inwardly with the Absolute.)/

/John Adams:/ O Almighty Being, I feel from within that in a few hours' time my earth-pilgrimage will come to an end. Before I breathe my last, do bless me with the necessary capacity to offer You my constant gratitude-heart. I am grateful to You for having brought me into a religious family. I am grateful to You for having kept me active from birth to death, physically, vitally, mentally, psychically-in every possible way. I am grateful to you for having granted me the unparalleled opportunity to be one of the pioneer freedom-fighters. I am grateful to You for giving me the divine inspiration to urge the country to make George Washington Commander-in-Chief in our just battle for freedom-light. I am grateful to You for having given me the capacity to defend Captain Preston. Nobody was bold or kind enough to defend his case. But every man is entitled to a fair and just trial. I told my countrymen that the British officer only did his duty. As we were fighting for our country, he was under obligation to defend his country. I am grateful to You for the golden opportunity You gave me to serve You as head of the country. I am grateful to You for allowing my son, like me, to be head of the country. Finally, I am extremely grateful to You that I was able to listen to Your wishes. You did not want our country to be involved in a war against France when France attacked a few of our ships. You wanted to maintain peace as long as possible. I became my country's enemy. My countrymen called me a traitor. But I heard You inside my heart calling me a lover of peace and wisdom. Almighty Being, You gave me all this capacity: therefore, I am sincerely grateful to You.

/Absolute:/ John, My son, I am well pleased with you and your life's multifarious activities. You know, My son, today is the fourth of July.

/John Adams (his face immediately brightening):/ The most significant day in our country's life. The fourth of July, the fourth of July! My soul shall fly, my soul shall fly!

/Absolute:/ John, My boundless Pride is carrying you to Heaven for a rest which you so richly deserve. Your great friend and great rival Thomas Jefferson also will arrive in Heaven in a few hours' time. I shall carry his soul, too. I have chosen this day for you, My son, and for My other son, for both of you unquestionably deserve the beauty and glory of this day.

/John Adams:/ Lord, Lord, it was Jefferson who wrote in the Declaration of Independence, "All men are created equal." I have always carried this peerless message of his in my heart.

/Absolute:/ Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, but behind it was your constant, divine encouraging insistence. My Vision-Light was illumining not only your country but also the whole world through the Declaration of Independence. Both of you have proved to be My real divine instruments. John, I am so glad that you gave real importance to the fourth of July. You urged the nation to celebrate the fourth of July with amusing games, enchanting balls and inspiring bonfires. John, many people misunderstood you in many things. They even went to the length of calling you a stubborn mule. But I have always called you a truth-fighter with a volcano-will.

/John Adams:/ O Supreme Being, I implore Your last Blessing before You take me to the other shore.

/Absolute:/ Before I bless you and take you to My other Home, I shall sing a song for you.

/(The Absolute sings:/

/(In Heaven. The Absolute, George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson.)/

/Absolute:/ George, John and Thomas, you three have worked very hard for your country's independence. Now your country is a free nation. Are you not happy?

/John Adams:/ Of course we are.

/Thomas Jefferson:/ But it was all Your Grace, Your unconditional Grace.

/George Washington:/ Of late I have been feeling that if America could make more inner progress, then her outer success would be more illumining, more fulfilling.

/Absolute:/ You are completely right, My son. Now, tell Me something. Who said this while he was on earth: "Liberty, when it begins to take root, is a plant of rapid growth. "

/George Washington:/ Me! it was I who said that!

/Absolute:/ You are right in remembering what you once said. And I am right in telling you that your words are correct, O Father of America-Father, indeed, in body, vital, mind and heart; Father in action; Father in realisation.John, do you know who said this: "If it be the pleasure of Heaven that my country shall require the poor offering of my life, the victim shall be ready, at the appointed hour of sacrifice, come when that hour may. But while I do live, let me have a country, and that a free country..."?

/John Adams:/ Of course I know, Father. It was I who said it while I was on earth. And this was not a mere emotional outburst. It was an inner experience of mine. I am really and truly grateful to You, Father, for having given me that heart-nourishing and soul-illumining experience.

/Absolute:/ John, everything that I have is for you and for your brothers and sisters, for humanity, for my entire creation. Your enemies called you a stubborn mule, John, but I call you a determined truth-fighter.

/John Adams:/ I thank You from the very depths of my gratitude-heart.

/Absolute:/ And with your most striking receptivity you received Me, my world-illumining Light. For your extraordinary service to your country, you would have been known as a great man. But for the offering of your independence-declaration you are known as a good man, a God-messenger, a Vision-son of God.

/James Madison:/ "Here lies Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence, of the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom, and Father of the University of Virginia." /(Shedding tears of joy, pride and gratitude)/ Oh, tall and great you were. Tall, very tall. I am short, very short. As a tall tree in both the inner world and the outer world, do accept the soulful homage of a tiny helpless plant.

/Thomas Jefferson (appearing in spirit):/ James, who says that you are helpless? Who says that you are a tiny plant? Don't underestimate yourself. Nobody should blame you for the deplorable experience that the British have given our country by capturing Washington and setting fire to the White House. It was an absolutely unwarranted war. To me it is quite clear that England is doomed to swim always in the sea of ignorance. Just ask the eyeless British why they have to lord it over others. Have they nothing else to do? Anyway, let us forget that sad disaster as soon as possible. On my part, I am praying to the Almighty to grant the ignorant British some wisdom-light.

/James Madison:/ Jefferson, you are divinely great, supremely magnanimous.

/Thomas Jefferson:/ James, I am really proud of you for forming our national government. Now our states will not indulge in fruitless quarrels. You were so right when you said, after the Revolutionary War, that if we are to survive and excel, then there can be no other way than to form a national government. I am proud to call you the Father of the Constitution. I am extremely grateful to you for introducing the Bill of Rights. Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, the right to have a trial by jury if you are accused of a crime and the right to meet and complain about an unfair law-these are the things that a free country needs. James, once more I tell you, I am proud of you beyond your imagination.

/James Madison:/ May I always be worthy of your pride in me! May I be worthy of your unconditional encouragement. I admired you most while you were in the body, and now that you are in the spirit I worship and adore you.

George Washington, the Father of the Nation, showed me much affection, yet I am not happy. The great Jefferson said to me, "Monroe is so honest that if you turned his soul inside out, there would be no spot upon it," yet I am not happy. When I ran for a second term as president, it can almost be said that nobody ran against me, yet I am not happy. People called my time as president "the era of good feeling," yet I am not happy. While I was in office the boundary line was established between our country and Canada. This is indeed the world's most inspiring, encouraging and illumining example of disarmament: an unbelievably unfortified border. To a great extent I am responsible for that, yet I am not happy. The hero in me spoke when I asked Spain and other European nations to keep their hands off North and South America, yet I am not happy. When our Latin American neighbours wanted to free themselves from the Spaniards, I encouraged, even assisted them, yet I am not happy. Nothing on earth is giving me any satisfaction. I must needs leave this shore for the other shore where my most esteemed colleagues Washington, Jefferson and Madison are enjoying their well-deserved rest. Needless to say, I too need some rest. /(With folded hands)/ It is the fourth of July, the most significant day in our country's history. May I be blessed with the boon from You that, like Adams and Jefferson, I too may leave my body today. /(A bright light from above descends on Monroe./ ) Lord, You have heard my prayer. Not only do I offer You this earth's body, but also my Heaven's soul I surrender to Your divine care.

/Louisa Adams:/ John, God alone knows how kind and good you are. Your heart cries to elevate the weak, to help the needy. Your service to the country is the colossal pride of Heaven. Name and fame you spurned. You dared to serve your country as a congressman after having served as President. What does this prove? It proves that what always comes first and foremost with you is not personal recognition but the service of your country in any capacity. John, I am proud to be your wife. I shall pray to the Almighty that He allow me to follow you to the other world, for without you my life will be fruitless and useless. John, you are a supreme fighter to the end. Our Lord in Heaven will bless you with tremendous joy and pride. You are sailing your life-boat to Him. Mine, too, I shall sail to Him before long.

/Friend:/ Lincoln, you are really great, you are really good. God gave you a unique heart. What our great thinker Emerson said of you is so true. Your "heart is as great as the world. But there is no room in it to hold a wrong."

/Abraham Lincoln:/ Friend, I have done nothing to make any human being remember that I have lived.

/Friend:/ That is your modesty speaking. Outwardly you are very tall. Inwardly, also, you are very tall.

/Abraham Lincoln:/ I am nothing, and I am prepared to remain nothing all my life. But I want our country to be something great, really great, so that the world will appreciate and admire it. Alas, how can the world appreciate our country while there is still slavery? As long as there is slavery in the nation, there can be no oneness-discovery. When I was young, I once saw a beautiful Negro girl for sale at a slave auction. I took an oath on that very day to put an end to slavery. Since then I have been praying to God every day to grant me the opportunity and capacity to put an end to this most deplorable state of affairs.

/Friend:/ I tell you, Abraham, God will definitely listen to your prayer. Just wait and see. If God does not fulfil such a good and pure desire as yours, then what kind of prayers will He fulfil?

/Abraham Lincoln:/ Friend, you are kind. Pray for me; pray for the fulfilment of my heart's desire.

/Friend:/ I shall. And I am sure God will grant your prayer.

/Abraham Lincoln:/ Do you know that there is someone here who failed in business in 1831, who was defeated for the Legislature in 1832, who failed in business again in 1833, who suffered a nervous breakdown in 1836, who was defeated for speaker in 1838, who was defeated for Elector in 1840, who was defeated for Congress in 1843 who was defeated for Congress in 1848, who was defeated for Senate in 1855, who was defeated for Vice-President in 1856 who was defeated for Senate in 1858?

/Friend:/ And who was elected President of the United States in 1860! My dear friend, what you have /been/ is of no consequence. What you have /become/ is of /paramount/ importance.

You were a supreme scientist, you were a supreme lover and builder of your country. Your sublime contribution to me can only be felt and not described. Benjamin, the oldest and the wisest of all, do you still care for America?

/Soul of Benjamin Franklin:/ I do, I do. While I was on earth I said: "Where liberty dwells, there is my country." Even now I treasure this life-illumining feeling.

/Soul of America:/ Marvellous, marvellous! William was founder of Philadelphia and you, Benjamin, are Philadelphia's first citizen. Yesterday I composed a song on Philadelphia. It is only you and William who deserve it. Therefore I want to present it to you both.

/(The Soul of America sings:)/

/(Everybody applauds with tremendous joy.)/

/Soul of America:/ Now I wish all of you to quote something from your own lofty messages which you offered to the soul of the earth while you were in the physical. /(Looking at William Penn)/ William, O English Quaker, preacher and writer, you followed the inner light, which is a /must/ for everybody. Because of your religion and religious feeling, repeatedly you were imprisoned. Such is human stupidity. Now it is your turn.

/Soul of William Penn:/ "In all debates, let Truth be the aim, not victory."

/Soul of America:/ Marvellous, marvellous! Nathan, who told you that you were a spy? No, you definitely were not. You were a supreme lover of your country. You were at once earth's colossal sacrifice and Heaven's hallowed satisfaction. Yours was the heart of sublime promise-light. Yours was the life of glorious sacrifice-might. Many martyrs are buried in oblivion-night and many more shall be. But you will always be remembered not only by your own countrymen but by all freedom-lovers in all freedom-loving countries. Nathan, suppose you are given another chance; this time what would you do?

/Soul of Nathan Hale:/ Mother, this time I would give my life for my country's spiritual liberty. This is the liberty from desire-life and temptation-life. This liberty is a giant stride towards world-transformation and perfection. The outer liberty is of very little value if the inner liberty is wanting. In the inner world, we prepare ourselves for God the One. In the outer world, we offer ourselves to God the Many. A hero I was in the outer world. A hero my heart longs to be in the inner world. Here I shall have to conquer the bondage-day and ignorance-night for myself and for all human beings on earth.

/Soul of America:/ Son, I am so pleased to hear that. Yours is not a human promise. Yours is a divine promise. The Lord Himself is speaking in and through you. By the way, Nathan, how I wish to hear from your lips now the soul-stirring message you gave before you breathed your last, before you embraced the gallows.

/Soul of Nathan Hale:/ Mother, I have set a beautiful tune to my message. May I sing it for you?

/Soul of America:/ That is a great idea. Sing it for me, my son.

/(Nathan Hale sings "I only regret that I have but one life to give for my country.")/

/Soul of Henry David Thoreau:/ "Things do not change, we change."

/Soul of America:/ Marvellous, marvellous! Walt, you were a hero-seeker of Truth. You were a hero-lover of mankind. Your /Leaves of Grass/ is treasured by both Heaven and earth. You not only saw the soul in the body, but also saw the body as the soul-reality. A transformed and illumined body-consciousness for God-satisfaction was your goal. By the way, while you were on earth, you were extremely fond of taking long-distance walking tours to other countries. Now that you are in Heaven you do not walk. You fly and fly. Do you miss your walking days?

Please tell me that you will fulfil my request, my heart's desire. You will go to India only after I have gone to the other world, not before.

You are great, you are greater and you are greatest because you want peace. I am the soul of India. I want peace too, peace all over the world. India has many faults, but India's true love for peace nullifies all her shortcomings. My son Krishna wanted peace between the Pandavas and the Kauravas. But when he saw that peace was not going to take birth in a divine way, he agreed to settle the issue through war. He advised the Pandavas to fight for the right cause. On being attacked, your country had to fight in World War I and World War II to defend herself and thus establish and maintain the Kingdom of Truth and World Peace. Your country's vision and my country's vision run parallel. Although at times your America and my India are at odds, they basically love each other, for both have the self-same goal: a peaceful life. My son Gandhi cried and cried for peace. Almost all of your predecessors also cried for peace. The whole world is so proud of Washington, the Father of your nation. He wanted nothing but peace. From him, all of you have imbibed the message of peace. Eisenhower, you and your country want peace. My children and I want peace. Therefore, we are one. In your first inaugural address, your prayer to God was pure and sublime. You said, "Give us, we pray, the power to discern clearly right from wrong, and allow all our words and actions to be governed thereby, and by the laws of this land. Especially we pray that our concern shall be for all the people regardless of station, race, or calling." In your second inaugural address, you said something divine and supreme. You said, "This is our home, yet this is not the whole of our world. For our world is where our full destiny lies -- with men, of all peoples and all nations, who are or would be free. And so the prayer of our people carries far beyond our own frontiers, to the wide world of our duty and our destiny. May the light of freedom, coming to all darkened lands, flame brightly -- until at last the darkness is no more."

/Dwight D. Eisenhower:/ O Soul of Mother India, you have an astonishing memory. I fully agree with you about India and America. I feel that India has the God ordained vision and America has the God-ordained mission. Both vision and mission must be united to give birth to humanity's perfection in life. You are so right.

/(The World-soul, the soul of England and the soul of America in the Abode of the ever-transcending Heights.)/

/World-soul:/ My sweet daughter, England-soul, are you not happy now? Possession is not happiness. Renunciation is happiness. And if renunciation is God-ordained, then it is perfect happiness. It was God who wanted you to renounce your possession-authority. Look, now your daughter America is happy and you are happy. Needless to say, I am happy too.

/Soul of England:/ Mother, once I was temptation-possession, but now I am illumination-oneness. And I unmistakably and gratefully know that it was all your doing.

/World-soul:/ My daughter, what we need to know is not so much whose doing it was, but whether the thing is done. I am glad beyond measure that the thing is done, the right thing is done.

/Soul of America:/ Grandmother, Mother has taught me many nice things, and two things I treasure most: her mind's lofty nobility and her life's non-sentimental, or non-emotional but measured and confident progress along the road of Eternity's perfection.

/World-soul:/ You are absolutely right, my granddaughter. Now I would like both you and your mother to do me a big favour. Please sing me the song that says, "My Captain says go on."

/(The souls of England and America sing:/

#+BEGIN_VERSE

There was a time when I stumbled and stumbled,
But now I only climb and climb beyond
And far beyond my Goal's endless Beyond,
And yet my Captain commands: "Go on, go on!"

/And then they sing:/

#+BEGIN_VERSE

America, America, America!
Great you are, good you are,
Brave you are, kind you are.
O my America, America.
Your Heaven-freedom is earth’s aspiration-choice.
With you, in you, is God-Hour’s Victory-Voice.
