#+BEGIN_VERSE

A happy union reigns supreme
When beauty's light
And duty's delight
   Meet together.

A happy oneness reigns supreme
When earth's cry
And Heaven's smile
   To each other lose.

* 2. Union

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: poem

  :cite-key: UO:2
  :END:


#+BEGIN_VERSE

Union with God
   Is not and cannot be total satisfaction.
But oneness with God
   Is total and constant satisfaction.
Union is not oneness.
   Union can be withdrawn.
Union is not and cannot be always safe;
   It cannot be eternal.
But oneness can never be withdrawn.
Once oneness is established,
   No matter on which plane,
Everything is established.
Then abiding satisfaction takes place
   In the aspiring heart.

   Oneness with our role
Makes us feel
   That we can eventually become great.
   Oneness with our soul
Makes us feel
   That we can eventually become good.
   Oneness with our goal
Makes us feel
   That the goal,
      The soul
         And
            The role
   Are of us,
      In us
         And
            For us.
   Why?
Because the Source is for us
            And
The flow is also for us.

   Real sincerity
Is the sincerity
That sees reality
The way reality wants to be seen,

Does not see reality
With its own eye.
   Real sincerity
Sees reality
With the eye of reality itself.

Let us surrender to God
   Not only what we have
But also what we are.
What we have
   Is a real inner cry for God.
What we are

      With ignorance.
Let us offer both
   To the Pilot within.

   And that is God the Compassion,
      God the eternal Compassion.

Selflessness is:
I am of God,
I am for God,
Him to please,
Him to serve
In His own way
At every moment
Is my heart's selflessness.

Selflessness is
Heart-giving,
Life-giving.
What we call selflessness today

   The day after, that very thing
   Becomes God-oneness,
   Eternity's God-oneness.

Imagination was aspiration.
Inspiration was aspiration.
Now aspiration is inspiration.

When imagination was aspiration
I felt that I was of my inner Pilot
      And
I was for my inner Pilot.

When inspiration was aspiration
I felt that I could fly
To my Eternity's Beloved Supreme.

When aspiration is inspiration,
When the real becomes conscious
   Of its existence in us,
God the unmanifested Reality
   Becomes not only the manifested Reality
   But the only Reality
In the world of glowing hope,
In the world of flowing reality.

The human in us
Cries and climbs

The golden thread that unites
   Our heart's climbing cry
      With
   Heaven's descending smile.

* 17. To be free

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: poem

#+BEGIN_VERSE

Why do I want to be free?
   If I want to be free
   Because the rest of the world is bad,
Then God will ask me
To create another world of my own
   Since His creation has failed me.

   But if I want to be free
   So that I can be of greater service
   To my sisters and brothers,
   To God's entire creation,
Then God in me selects the hour,
And at that choice hour
   The aspiring human in me achieves
   Freedom from life's ignorance-night.

If I want to be free
To love the world,
   To be part and parcel of the world,
Then God is all eagerness
   To grant me freedom.
But if I want to be free
Because the world is full of ignorance,
The world is nothing but a devouring tiger,
   Then God feels that I am not the right person
   For Him to grant freedom to.
He will grant me freedom
   Only when He sees that this freedom
   Is for dedicated service,
For the transformation of the Human race.

Transformation of the mind

The transformation of the mind

To speak ill of the world
   Needs courage,
But fortunately or unfortunately
   Everybody has that courage.

To love the world
   As one's own,
   Very own,
   Needs courage.
Unfortunately, most of us are wanting
   In that courage.

The courage of the heart,
The courage of the soul
   We badly need,
And not the courage
   Of the unruly,
      Aggressive,
         Impure,
            Demanding vital.

Inside the soulful cry
   Purity-seed germinates.
This seed will one day grow into a tiny plant,

Cry and try, try and cry.
There is no other way

   The purity-banyan tree.

The self-offering of the lower self
Is the self-offering

The self-offering of the higher self
Is the self-offering
   Of something which we eternally are
      But unfortunately
      Are not aware of.
Our false life we are claiming as our own.
Our true life, natural life,
   We are not claiming as our own.
The higher life is our true life.

Obedience
   Is not blind self-giving

Obedience
   Has to be full of inner recognition
   Of our high, higher, highest part

What do we have to give?
We have to give what we see,
We have to give what we feel,
We have to give what we claim,
We have to give what we are
   In the outer world
      To the Source.
This moment we are ignorance-prince;
   Next moment we are aspiration-prince.
This moment we represent darkness and ignorance;
   Next moment we represent light and delight.
Whatever we represent at any moment
Should be offered to the Lord Supreme.
If this moment we represent ignorance,
   Then we must offer it.
If the next moment we represent wisdom-light,
   Then we must offer it.
Then at every moment
   We can drink from the fount

   Humility
Is not the helpless surrender
To something or someone else.
   Humility
Is not a frightened child.
   Humility
Is real receptivity in us.
   If we receive with devoted humility,
Then immediately our receptivity-vessel increases.
   Humility

The transformation of the body
   Comes last.
The transformation of the heart
   Comes first.
How does the transformation of the heart
   Take place?
The transformation of the heart takes place
   When a seeker can consciously feel
   That he is not the body
      And
   He is not of the body,
      But
   He is for the body.
To be for the body does not mean
To be satisfied with the animal propensities,
To wallow in the pleasures of ignorance.
But if the seeker cries
   For the transformation of the body
   And the body-consciousness,
   Then the seeker becomes perfect.
   Once we transform the body,
      This body can then be utilised
      For God-manifestation on earth.

By looking at a flower,
By looking at the moon

By looking at the candle flame

Once purification takes place in the mind,
Slowly and steadily
The body and vital become pure.
Mental purity comes first
