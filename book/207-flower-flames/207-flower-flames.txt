I have selected 207 poems out of 10,000 from my series, /Ten thousand Flower-Flames/, which was originally published in 100 volumes. Here the poet in me is soulfully satisfied, the reader in me is smilingly satisfied and the critic in me is surprisingly satisfied.

My Beloved Supreme, what more can I tell You, and what more do You expect from me?

"Be quiet, My poet-reader-critic-son. The Hour, My Hour, is about to strike.
