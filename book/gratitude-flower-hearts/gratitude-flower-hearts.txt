In this month
I shall succeed,
I shall definitely succeed
In my outer life.
Do you know why?
Because
I have compelled my old enemy, ignorance,
To return my determination-fire.

In this month
I shall proceed,
I shall amazingly proceed
In my inner life.
Do you know why?
Because
My old Friend, God, my Beloved Supreme,
Is once more blessing me
With His infinite Compassion-Suns.

For God's Victory-Banner.

A sleepless self-giver
Is God's Victory-Banner-carrier.

Is God's creation-transformer.
A sleepless self-giver
Is God's Heart-biographer.

Although there have been few,
Very few in number,
Mother-Earth is extremely happy

Do not give; you are lost.
Do not give; you are dead.
Give and give and give
Only to the Supreme in humanity.

1. Love

2. Devotion

3. Surrender

4. Gratitude

5. Obedience

6. I belong to my Beloved Supreme.

7. Him to manifest in His own Way I came into this world.

If I take all these seven steps cheerfully, willingly and unconditionally, then my Beloved Supreme, without fail, will consider me a supremely chosen instrument, an absolutely perfect instrument of His.

The Supreme and your soul are not going to please your body, vital, mind and heart with the hope that in return your body, vital, mind and heart will please your soul and the Supreme. If you have an iota of wisdom, then start threatening your idle body, aggressive vital, suspicious mind and insincere heart.

Just think for five minutes of what you were before you joined the spiritual path. Just think for ten minutes of what you have become on the spiritual path. Just think for an hour of what you will become in the future if you leave the spiritual path.

May this calamity-month be transformed into a prosperity-month for those who are doing extremely well and are trying most sincerely to please their Beloved Supreme in His own Way.

Let us not take a break, let us not.
Let us continue
With our poor aspiration
And with our feeble dedication.

Let us not take a break, let us not.
For God-realisation is still a far cry,
God-manifestation is almost an impossible task
And God-satisfaction is far, far, far
Beyond our imagination.

Let us not take a break, let us not.
For there may come a time
When our Beloved Lord Supreme,
Out of His unconditional Compassion,
Will infinitely increase
The purity of our aspiration
And infinitely increase
The beauty of our dedication
To realise Him,
To manifest Him
And to satisfy Him
In His own Way.

My dear Lord Supreme, many have failed; many more are failing; still many more may eventually fail. Please tell me my status. Where do I stand with regard to my spiritual life?

"My child, because of your disobedience you have already failed once. My child, because of your impurity in your entire being you are failing now. My child, because of your ingratitude you will eventually fail again."

My dear Supreme, that means mine is a hopeless case!

"My child, perhaps it is so.

"Now, My child, I want to tell you something most secret and most sacred. Listen to Me devotedly and soulfully once and for all. When I talk to you about your soul, you have to realise that your soul is always, always aware of My infinite Compassion, of My infinite Concern, of My infinite and unconditional Affection and Love for you. Your soul is always and always at My Protection-Feet, and from My Protection-Feet sleeplessly it receives My Illumination-Light.

"I am proud of your soul because it knows who I am, because it wants to please Me always in My own Way. Because of your soul I repeatedly forgive you. Because of your soul I grant you again and again chance after chance to please Me in My own Way.

"Your soul has not yet accepted defeat, and it will never accept the final defeat. Therefore, I shall give you innumerable chances to please Me and be a perfect instrument of Mine.

"I consider you a human being just because of your soul. I consider you an instrument of Mine just because of your soul. If your soul gives up the fight in the battlefield of your life, then yours will be a perpetual failure.

"So, My child, believe in your soul, the real reality, and not in your body, vital, mind or even your heart. If you do what I am asking you to do, then your soul and I will definitely succeed, not only in the battlefield of your life but also in manifesting My Immortality's Divinity in and through you."

God the Compassion-Height requests me
To be regular in my dedication-life.
God the Justice-Light commands me
To be punctual in my aspiration life.

I am my Lord's only Choice.
In His outer Life,

Supreme, Supreme, I bow to Thee.

Supreme, my Supreme, my dear Supreme,
My sweet Supreme, my Lord Supreme,
My Beloved Supreme,
May Thy Victory be proclaimed
At every moment in and through
My aspiration-heart and my dedication-life.

Supreme, my Supreme, my dear Supreme,
My sweet Supreme, my Lord Supreme,
My Beloved Supreme,
Those who are not consciously with You
And those who are not soulfully for You
Can never, never be my oneness-friends
Or ever, ever be in Your Infinity's
Vision-flooded Golden Boat.

Supreme, my Supreme, my dear Supreme,
My sweet Supreme, my Lord Supreme,
My Beloved Supreme,
Do make my heart a sleepless hunger-cry
For You, only for You.
