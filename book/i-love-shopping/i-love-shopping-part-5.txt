In Yogyakarta I wanted to buy a fan. The lady in the store smiled at me and said 500 rupiah.

I said 200, and she gave me the same smile. She gave me the same smile even when I bought the fan for only 200 rupiah.

* Talking soul to soul

In Bali I went into a music store to buy an instrument. The owner said, "80,000 rupiah," and I said, "No, 60,000." We were haggling for such a long time. Finally, he agreed to 70,000.

Then I saw two bamboo flutes on his desk. I examined the flutes, and one of them I liked very much. But the man said, "I am not going to sell this flute, because it is my personal flute. I play this one every day, so I don't want to sell it."

His soul was very open to me, and it was telling me to take that flute, but the man did not want to give it to me. He said, "Take the other one-the smaller one."

To myself I said, "The physical plane and the spiritual plane will never go together."

Because his soul was telling me to take the flute, I said to the man, "You have to give it to me. During the day there is no moon, but the moon will beg you to give it to me."

Then I asked, "What is your name?"

He said, "Madhu Chandra."

I said, "Are you a Hindu?"

"I am a Hindu," he replied.

Then I took the flute I wanted and said, "I will break the flute over your head if you don't give it to me." Savyasachi just looked at me.

Finally the man said, "All right. The flute has a fixed price of 1,000 rupiah.

You are getting the instrument for 70,000, plus l,000, so it is 71,000 rupiah."

Then I gave him 70,000 and another 10,000 by mistake. I thought I had given him only 1,000. He looked at me and said that I had made a mistake and gave me the change.

Then he started helping Savyasachi with the big instrument. Savyasachi told him that I was a great musician, and the man was very happy that he had met a great musician.

His soul wanted me to have the flute, but his mind would not give it to me. So I said to myself, "The only way to get the flute is to threaten to break his head."

Bali is the land of simplicity. Otherwise, would I ever dare talk to anybody like that? It was just soul to soul that we were talking. He was such a sweet soul!

I was in an Indian sweet shop in Bayside yesterday buying jalabee for prasad. A young man recognised me and was so surprised. He said, "Oh boy!"

Then he saw Databir and asked, "How could Sri Chinmoy come here and go shopping?"

He has come twice to our meditations at P.S. 86 and is used to seeing me in my high meditative consciousness. He couldn't believe that I was standing in front of the counter buying jalabee.

On my first piano anniversary, X blessed me with a cake, and Y also blessed me with a cake. Then I went to a store to get three more cakes.

The lady asked, "The cakes are for whom?"

I answered, "They are for me, because I play the piano."

She asked, "When are you going to play at Carnegie Hall?"

I said, "I have already played there."

She did not believe me.

Then I said that I have also played at the Royal Albert Hall in London and the Sydney Opera House. In the beginning she did not believe me at all. After I mentioned five or six places, maybe she believed me. Or perhaps she herself had never heard of those places!

Databir brought me to a mall and left me there, and I was nicely shopping. When I went inside one store, the shopkeeper asked me, "Are you from India?"

I answered, "Yes."

He said, "That's why you have such a tan."

Perhaps he thought I was tanned because I had just come from India. He was very white.

I said, "Yesterday spring started."

He said, "You are wrong. Today spring started."

I said, "All right, yesterday or today spring started, but it is still very cold."

He said something like "Bad luck!" Then he said, "Why are you not taking this item? If you don't like it, you will be able to return it."

I said, "I am not coming back here to return it."

When I go shopping, how much talking I do with these people!

This morning I went shopping in a mall. X drove me there, and Y was the distinguished back-seater.

In one store I was browsing through a book called /How to Become a U.S. Citizen./ My soul was telling me not to waste my time because it does not want me to become a U.S. citizen. The book had so many facts that had to be learned if someone wanted to become a U.S. citizen: what was the capital of this state; how many members there are in the Senate and Congress; and so forth. How do people remember all these things?

An elderly woman about 70 years old asked me, "Where do you come from?"

I answered, "India."

She said, "Do you have a green card?"

I said, "Yes, I have a green card."

She asked, "Now you want to become a citizen?"

"No, no," I replied.

Then I turned around and started looking at books in the religion section. I bought some books about Socrates, Buddha and the Christ. I also saw a tiny booklet by Thomas Merton. Vidagdha had written her Masters' thesis on him. The lady was still watching me. I saw one of my booklets, /The Fountain-Heart of Wisdom./ The price sticker was over the word 'Wisdom', and I was trying to read the title behind the sticker. The lady saw me trying to read the title and she said, "Wisdom." Then she said, "By Sri Chinmoy -- wise guy Sri Chinmoy."

I was quite amused and just smiled at her. I didn't have the heart to tell her I was that wise guy.

Today I went to a bakery to buy heart-shaped cookies for prasad. I have been to that store so many times, and usually they are very nice, but this time they didn't pay any attention to me.

While I was there, a young boy of 14 or 15 years took an ice cream cone from the display case and started eating it without paying. The lady went inside to inform the manager. Then a stout man came out.

The boy did not run away. He just walked out with no fear. He was so daring.There were two or three other customers, but they just watched.

For another five minutes they did not serve me. Finally I said, "I need about 200 of these cookies."

They said they had no time to count them. Then I asked for a quarter pound.

They asked, "Why do you want a quarter pound?"

I replied, "I will be able to count how many are in a quarter pound, and then I will know how many pounds I have to buy in order to get 200."

They said, "We don't understand."

Finally I got my 200 heart cookies.

While I am standing on a line, if I hear the word 'credit card', I go away! Today I was so lucky! The old lady in front of me said, "Cash!"

While the cashier was taking care of her, the poor lady removed her glasses and put them into her glasses case. She forgot to put the case back in her purse and went away without it. I saw what had happened, so I took the glasses and tried to find her. But I am lame and cannot walk very fast, and I didn't know in which direction to go. I was praying to God that I could find her.

Then I saw her browsing only five or six metres away. I was a little doubtful that it was the right lady, so I asked, "Are these yours?"

She was so happy. She said, "I do this thing all the time. I am so grateful to you."

I bought a white coat that cost $165.08. I gave the man at the cash register $166. While he was taking care of me, a young man came up and started talking to him. What keys they press on the cash register, God knows!

When the man left, the cashier gave me back one dollar and some change. I asked him, "Why did you give me the dollar?"

He said, "Why not? That's what the computer says."

I said, "They might fine you."

"They will fire me?"

I said, "No, I said they might fine you."

He said, "The world needs honest people like you. All right, then let me just give you the change."

I said, "You already gave it to me. The change is in my pocket."

When I went to Vinaya's car, I saw that the change he had given me was only 58 cents instead of 92 cents. He had not meant to deceive me; he had wanted to give me more change.

At Main Street, near my four-mile mark, there is a shopping mall. From outside you can't tell that it is a mall, but once you enter, you see all the stores.

Yesterday Databir took me to that mall and I was buying something. The man said, "$60."

I said, "$40."

Then the man said "Come here." He was very rough.

I said to myself, "Physically I know we won't fight, so why do I have to worry?"So I went towards him very powerfully.

He said, "I said $60, and you have to say $40?"

I said, "You don't have to sell it."

Then he said, "Can you not go higher?"

I said, "I am not going higher."

He said, "Just yesterday I sold one like this for $55."

So I said, "No, I can't go higher," and I walked away. Later, when I was passing by him again, he said, "Hey! Why do you have to act like that?" Then he said something that was insulting. This time I did not go near him.

Then he said, "$55."

I said, "I won't give you more than $50." Then he said, "All right, take it. Just because it is the last one, I am giving it to you for $50."

Sometimes people treat you so mercilessly, but I enjoy their talk! When I go shopping, I become part and parcel of the shopping world and all my headaches go away. It is great fun! This is the only way I can mix with people at their own level.

While I was shopping, I wanted to buy some Chinese egg rolls. The lady didn't understand my English, and I didn't understand her English. I said, "No meat, no fish-only vegetables."

She understood "vegetables."

Outside in the display case the egg rolls had meat, fish and God knows what inside them, so she brought me egg rolls from inside. She repeated the words, "No meat, no fish!"

She was so simple and humble, but I suspected her. I said, "Can you cut one for me?"

When she cut it, I saw that it was full of fish. See how she wanted to deceive me!

I said, "I was going to get them, but now I don't trust you." Then I started going away.

She said, "Please wait for a few minutes. I will make special ones for you."

I sat there waiting for five or six minutes. I said to myself, "This time I hope she will be sincere." When she brought the egg rolls, I didn't have the heart to ask her to cut them again. When I brought them home, I saw they were all vegetables.

I go shopping and bring back a Mahabharata of stories!

I know you! I saw you for the first time when I was three years old in Flatbush. My mother lives in Brooklyn, and she has come to your meditations many times."

She gave me the store card and asked me to autograph it.

I said, "What is your name?"

She said, "You don't have to write down my name. Just write your name."

I said, "Yes, but I would like to know your name."

She said, "Ayesha."

So I wrote, "Dear Ayesha, with my good wishes," and I signed it. She was so happy.

This world is so small. She used to live in the Flatbush area. I also used to live there. Now she is 16 or 17 years old and lives in Woodstock, which I have visited so many times over the past 24 years.

They were speaking in Bengali, so I asked if they were Bengali, and we started talking in Bengali.

The man asked me, "Do you live here?"

I said, "No, I come from America."

He told me that he had been living in Korea for six years. He said he was a famous engineer.

Then he asked me what part of Bangladesh I came from.

I said, "I come from Chittagong."

He said, "I come from a place you do not know."

When he told me the name, I said, "It is a very famous place. So many great Bengali writers were born there."

The man did not know the names of the writers that I mentioned.

Then his wife said, "Please come to our house to give us the dust of your feet."

That is the Bengali way of saying, "Just come and eat."

I said, "I am here with so many people. I will not be able to come."

She said, "Just come for a few minutes. You are such a wise man." But the husband did not want me to come and got very mad. He and his wife started fighting. The man said, "He will come on my deathbed!"

I said, "I don't want you to die." Then I disappeared.

She said, "No, you have to give me three more." Since I was bargaining, I told the lady I had no more money.

I thought that all my money was in my left pocket and that only some papers were in my right pocket. To show the lady that I had no more money, I pulled all the papers out of my right pocket. O God, so much money came out!

The shopkeeper said, "You have money."

What was I going to do? I smiled at her very soulfully and offered her the other three dollars, but she didn't take it. She gave me the item for $10.

When I said I had no money, I was not telling a lie. I was just bargaining in my Indian manner. But after she saw all my money, I smiled at her and she became so nice!

From the beginning he was saying $19, whereas I thought he was saying $90. Then when he said $17, I thought he was saying $70.

So he came running after me to give me $35 back. I looked at him and gave him a $10 tip. He was so happy with that $10.

As soon as she left, I took $50 out of my wallet and gave it to them. In Tamil I said, "It is sufficient."

O God, the manager overheard me speaking Tamil. She practically came running over and grabbed the bill from her assistant. She smiled at me and said, "You speak Tamil?"

I said, "For twenty years I lived in South India!"

Then she gave me the books for $50.
