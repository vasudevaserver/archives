My Faith's immortal shore.
So, be careful,

And has accepted the fact.

I have brought God down
And placed Him before human beings
Quite unexpectedly.
Yet God loves me.

Sri Chinmoy wrote these 365 poems in honour of Father's Day, June 16, 1974. They were written during the 72-hour period from 6:00 p.m. June 10th (while he was on the plane to Puerto Rico) to 5:45 p.m. June 13th during the time of his visit to the San Juan Sri Chinmoy Centre.

The Master offered this prayerful gift to his spiritual children of the Puerto Rican Sri Chinmoy Centres, and to his Centres in all other parts of the world. On Father's Day a special dedication of this volume was made to the Guru by the disciples who worked in the printing of the book. On that occasion, each of the 365 poems was recited to the accompaniment of soulful music.

Sri Chinmoy expressed his deepest and most loving gratitude to the disciples who worked for three days and nights on the book, many of them staying up all night for three consecutive nights, and getting only snatches of sleep during the day, typing, varietyping, proofreading, making plates and negatives, masking, printing, collating and binding this book of poems. The temperature hovered near 98° all during this time.

The Guru is extremely proud of his Puerto Rican children.
