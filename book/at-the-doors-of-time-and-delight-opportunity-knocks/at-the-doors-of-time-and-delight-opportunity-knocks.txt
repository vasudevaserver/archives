* Question: What is the significance of this Vedic mantra: From Delight we came into existence. In Delight we grow. At the end of our journey’s close into Delight we retire.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:1
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ This is the sublime message offered to us by the Vedic seers of the hoary past: Delight was our inner past. Delight is our inner present. Delight shall be our inner future.

Delight is the source of existence. Delight is the meaning of existence. Delight is the language of Infinity, Eternity and Immortality.



* Question: When we experience delight, how can we keep it and when we are experiencing it, how can we keep transcending it?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:2
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ When we experience delight, we can keep it by offering our soulful gratitude to the Supreme and we can keep transcending it by offering our ever-increasing gratitude to the Supreme.



* Question: Is it possible to invoke or meditate upon delight and bring it down from above, or does delight gradually become more evident to us as we surrender ourselves to it?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:3
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ You can invoke or meditate upon delight and bring it down from above. Again, when you surrender your will to God’s Will while purifying your emotional life, you can achieve delight. Delight will become evident to you.



* Question: I have always thought of delight as a lighter or less profound quality that we might see, for example, in a child whom we find ‘delightful’. What is the divine meaning of delight?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:4
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Unfortunately you are wrong if you think that delight is a lighter, less profound quality, which we see in a ‘delightful’ child. Delight is Eternity’s Treasure and Immortality’s Life. A delightful child may very often lose his life of delightful experience when he grows into an adolescent. His experience of this kind of delight can be something quite transitory. But when real divine delight enters into an aspirant, it is an everlasting experience. Now, what is the divine meaning of delight? The divine meaning of delight is Immortality in one’s entire being.



* Question: How can one share delight with aspiring and unaspiring people?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:5
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ One can share delight with aspiring people because they will value delight. They know that delight is the most important thing in life. Through aspiration and surrender we realise the Highest and at that time are able to share delight with others who are also aspiring. But to share delight with unaspiring people is the height of stupidity, for they do not want delight. We have no right to impose anything on others. Our imposition can never lead others to God-realisation.



* Question: Guru, could you tell me the difference between joy, bliss and delight?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:6
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Joy is in the physical plane. Bliss is in the inner plane, but it is centered around something specific. Delight, with its immortal light, runs throughout the entire being.

An unaspiring person can have joy, but he cannot have divine bliss or delight. Only a seeker can experience bliss and delight. Bliss is intensity. Delight is Immortality’s freedom flying constantly in Infinity’s sky.



* Question: When we feel delight during our day-to-day activities, how should we direct it?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:7
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ When we feel delight during our day-to-day activities, we should direct or apply it for the transformation of our emotional vital life and for the perfection of our earth nature, earth existence and earth bondage.



* Question: How can we expedite the growth of delight?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:8
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ We can expedite the growth of delight within us by constantly feeling that delight is the only thing that we needed, that we need and that we shall always need. Why? Because delight is our Immortality’s Life-Breath.



* Question: Guru, could you please tell me how to consciously taste the nectar of delight?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:9
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Forgive me for saying that you are not advanced enough to taste the nectar of delight right now. First pray and meditate. Please God in His own way. Then He will bless you with delight; at that time you can taste delight to your heart’s content. But right now try only to please God in His own way.



* Question: When can we expect to feel delight?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:10
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ We can expect to feel delight when we are ready; that is to say, when the Hour of God strikes within our aspiring heart.



* Question: How does delight manifest itself?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:11
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Delight manifests itself through the conscious and constant experience of earth’s suffering, earth’s cry, earth’s aspiration and earth’s perfection.



* Question: What is delight?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:12
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Delight is something which our aspiration-life constantly needs to manifest God on earth unreservedly and unconditionally.



* Question: How can we have delight in our day-to-day life?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:13
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ We can have delight in our day-to-day life by living only for God, by serving only God and by growing into the very image of God.

* Question: What are the external signs of the inner experience of delight and how does delight relate to love?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:14
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ A seeker will see the external signs of his inner experience of delight when his heart is embracing Heaven-Freedom and his eyes are illumining earth-bondage.

How does delight relate to love? Delight is love’s aspiration-height. Love is delight’s manifestation-might.



* Question: If I radiate my delight in a very unreserved way, am I more likely to increase or disperse it?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:15
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ If it is God’s Will for you to radiate your delight unreservedly, then definitely your delight will increase. If it is not His Will, you will undoubtedly disperse it.



* Question: Is delight a quality of consciousness or an occasional experience? How can we receive delight?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:16
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Delight is not a quality of consciousness. Consciousness experiences delight on the strength of its aspiration. If we have the real need for delight and if we are ready to cry constantly for it, then we receive delight.



* Question: Do human beings, because of their limited nature, experience delight as an entity separate from the Supreme?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:17
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ No. Delight can never be experienced as an entity separate from the Supreme, for the Supreme and Delight are inseparable. The Supreme at once embodies and manifests Delight.



* Question: You have said that it is very difficult to bring down delight for the disciples. Is there any particular reason for this?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:18
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ There are two reasons. One reason is that some disciples don’t aspire most sincerely and the other reason is that the physical and vital impurity of the disciples unconsciously or consciously resists the descent of delight.



* Question: Is Delight the highest aspect of the Supreme?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:19
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Peace, Light and Delight fall into the same category. These three qualities are the highest aspects of the Supreme. Peace spreads, Light illumines, Delight immortalises: these are their destined roles.



* Question: How does delight become manifest?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:20
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/: When Divinity’s Compassion and humanity’s aspiration meet together, delight becomes manifest on earth.



* Question: What is the easiest way to bring down delight into the physical being?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:21
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ The easiest way to bring down delight into the physical being is by making the physical more receptive, more dynamic and more self-giving.



* Question: How does delight relate to beauty?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa

  :cite-key: ADTD:22
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Beauty is the flower. Delight is the fragrant lustre of the flower.



* Question: “From Delight we came into existence. In Delight we grow. At the end of our journey’s close, into Delight we retire.” Could you comment on the above mantra?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:23
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ God has written an open letter to His human children. His letter runs: “My sweetest children, you are the only Delight of My universal Existence.”



* Question: How is the delight one experiences from ordinary worldly things or events related to spiritual delight?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:24
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Dearest child, one can never experience delight from ordinary worldly things or events. Spiritual delight is something that we eventually achieve or grow into on the strength of our highest aspiration and deepest dedication. What one experiences from ordinary worldly things is transitory pleasure or, on rare occasions, a kind of incomplete or human joy. Complete joy is not to be found in material things. Why? Material things are not consciously and constantly aspiring to become divine and perfect.



* Question: Is delight experienced automatically when one has reached a certain degree of refinement or expansion of consciousness, or a certain height of consciousness? If not, what is it that precipitates this state of delight?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:25
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ No matter what degree of refinement we have achieved, we cannot experience delight in its pristine beauty and immortality. It is through expanding and heightening our consciousness that we experience delight. We can precipitate the experience of delight only by increasing our unconditional self-giving and our conscious feeling that the Supreme loves us infinitely more than we love ourselves.

* Question: What is the difference between ecstasy, bliss and delight?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:26
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Ecstasy is something which we usually feel in our higher emotional or illumined vital. Bliss is something we feel in our aspiring, devoted heart. We also feel Bliss in the searching mind. Delight is something we feel from the soles of our feet to the crown of our head: it is the entire being that enjoys delight. Delight we feel throughout the body when we are spiritually dedicated, totally dedicated, and when we listen unconditionally to the dictates of the Supreme.

Again, when we speak of the highest kind of delight, the supreme Delight, we mean something more. Here we can say, along with the Vedic seers: “From Delight we came into existence. In Delight we grow. At the end of our journey’s close, into Delight we retire.”



* Question: What is the difference between joy, happiness and delight?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:27
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Joy and happiness are something ordinary in comparison to delight. Joy is limited, happiness is limited. We can experience them even in our ordinary unaspiring life. But delight we experience only when we lead an aspiring life. Only in the life of aspiration can we get delight. So you can say that joy is something earthly and delight is something Heavenly.



* Question: What Is the relationship between light and delight?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:28
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Light and delight are inseparable. Both embody the Truth, but each contains particular aspects of the Truth which we can invoke. When we invoke light, we feel that our life of ignorance, which has lasted for millennia, will be removed; we try to illumine our life of darkness. When we invoke delight, we feel that our suffering of millennia will be removed; we try to transform our pangs and suffering into delight.



* Question: In what way can delight be manifested?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:29
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Delight can be manifested on earth in various ways. It can be manifested as something that is eternal and immortal. Again, it can be manifested as something which pulls up our life of impurity and obscurity and transforms our ignorance.



* Question: Does delight come from Reality’s external freedom?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:30
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Delight does not come from Reality’s external freedom. Delight does not manifest in and through the external life, the extroverted life. Delight comes only from the silence of Reality’s inner, inseparable love.



* Question: What is real delight, where can it be found and how does one apply it to everyday living?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:31
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ What is real delight? Real delight is our constant communion with God. Where can it be found? It can be found only in our constant search for God and in our self-giving to God. How can we apply it to everyday living? We can apply this delight to everyday living if we feel that delight is the only fruit that can nourish us, strengthen us and immortalise us.



* Question: When people experience delight, do they experience it in the same way or is it an individual experience for each?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:32
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ People experience delight in different ways according to their power of receptivity. If different individuals have the same level of consciousness, they will experience delight in the same way and with the same intensity. Again, seekers who are not on the same plane of consciousness will experience delight in different ways. For example, when you see something from the top of a tree, you see it in one way. When you climb down to the middle of the trunk, you see the same thing in a different way. And when you stand at the foot of the tree, you may see it in still a different way. But again, if you have wide vision, very powerful vision, then from the top of the tree, from the middle of the tree and from the foot of a tree you will see a thing in the same way. This is also true of experiencing delight.



* Question: With the power of aspiration, can one consciously enter into Sat-Chit-Ananda and bring down delight into the mind, vital and physical?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:33
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ With the power of aspiration one can consciously enter into Sat-Chit-Ananda and bring down delight into the mind, vital and physical, provided one cares constantly for his Source. He has to feel that his Source is all he needs, he does not need anything else. He wants only the Source and nothing less.

We all know how affectionate our parents can be to us. When we are children, we feel our very existence depends on their kindness, their affection, their loving words, their smile. Always the child runs back to the source, the father and mother. Here our Source is Sat-Chit-Ananda. If we want to go back to our Source with loving joy, loving adoration for the Supreme, then without fail we can bring down the delight that we experience. When we either go deep within or climb high, higher, highest, we can bring down Peace, Light and Bliss and change the mental world in us, the vital world in us and the physical world in us.



* Question: Sometimes just after delight descends, giddiness, forced gaiety or fear of science steal our delight. What can we do about this?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:34
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Here we have to be sincere. Sometimes it is not actually delight that descends; it is only a kind of pleasure that enters into the seeker from the vital world which he mistakes for delight. This so-called delight naturally cannot and does not last for a long time. The real delight within us knows perfectly well that this is a false delight that is trying to please and satisfy the human in the aspirant, so the real delight comes and pushes aside the false delight. Now, the seeker may have identified himself to such an extent with the first kind of delight that when it leaves him, he feels sad and miserable. When this pleasure goes away, a kind of frustration comes, and in frustration, dissatisfaction looms large.



* Question: How can we expand our receptivity so that we can experience delight more constantly?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:35
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ There is only one way to expand our receptivity and that is through our constant remembrance of what we were, what we are and what we can be. We were animals. We are human beings trying to become divine and perfect. We will, by the Grace of the Absolute Supreme, eventually become divine, perfect and immortal. If we remember this, then automatically we expand our receptivity. Then we experience delight in abundant and boundless measure.



* Question: We have all felt delight when we meditate with you. What is the best way for us to spread delight to others around us?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:36
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ The best way is through inner communication. If you have meditated with me and you have achieved and received some delight, then afterwards if you see someone, do not talk to him about it. If you tell him about this divine quality, his mind will come forward and you will only be rejected. Also, if you talk about it, your own mind may lose its divinity because the mind is constantly suspecting. Only with the greatest difficulty can we illumine the mind. So please concentrate on the other person’s heart and feel that inside his heart is a big hole or that his heart itself is a hole. Try to put the delight and the other divine qualities that you have received from the Supreme in me into the hearts of those who are around you. Try to spread delight inwardly, in silence. If you do it in silence, it will be most effective.



* Question: Is it possible for man to experience constant delight or is delight only a passing experience?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:37
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ It is quite possible for an advanced seeker or a great spiritual Master to experience constant delight in the inner world. For the beginner, however, it is only a passing experience. But one does not remain a beginner forever. A child grows up and, as a grown-up, he acts the way his father or his mother does. In the same way, it is quite possible that there will come a time when one can experience delight constantly. Again, if one is not sincere enough, devoted enough or spiritual enough, naturally delight will always remain a passing experience.

  :PROPERTIES:

/Sri Chinmoy:/ When the aspirant decides to follow a spiritual path, it is not a human opportunity; it is a divine opportunity. More than that, it is a supreme opportunity. Human opportunity once lost is lost forever. Divine opportunity comes and goes and goes and comes. The supreme opportunity has the magnetic pull to lift the seeker to the highest plane of consciousness.



* Question: Are there always opportunities in life for spiritual development?

  :PROPERTIES:

/Sri Chinmoy:/ Yes, there are always opportunities in life for spiritual development, but if we avail ourselves of the opportunities each time they knock at our door, we can realise and manifest the Highest sooner than otherwise. Further, if we take each experience as a golden opportunity, we can become the colossal pride of our Pilot Supreme.

  :PROPERTIES:

/Sri Chinmoy:/ We can realise our divine opportunity even when we are working with very unaspiring people by becoming full of compassion and feeling that if we exercise our compassion-power, then the divine within us will be more pleased with us and make us strong. Then we will be unaffected by unaspiring people and can run fastest toward our goal.

/Sri Chinmoy:/ We can become aware of the God-given opportunities at each moment by discovering the fact that each moment is a golden opportunity to realise God, to reveal God and to manifest God.



* Question: Is opportunity self-made or predestined by our personal karma? Is it possible to increase our opportunity through surrender?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:44
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Yes, opportunity can be self-made and opportunity can be predestined, but self-made opportunity does not have abiding life in it, whereas when we get opportunity from the Grace of God, this opportunity has an everlasting life and an ever-illumining capacity.

Yes, it is quite possible to increase one’s opportunity through surrender-power.

/Sri Chinmoy:/ We can increase our capacity to serve Him devotedly and with ever-increasing gratitude if we can convince ourselves that we can exist on earth without air, water, food -- we can exist without everything else -- but not without God, even for a fleeting second.

  :PROPERTIES:

  :cite-key: ADTD:49

/Sri Chinmoy:/ Yes, opportunity is a gift: it is a grace. But this opportunity can be a real obstacle if it is misused badly. To have money, to have material wealth, is to have a great opportunity in serving the poor. But if you misuse the money-power, the opportunity you had now stands as an obstacle to your realisation of Truth and Light. Therefore, you must always try to use all your opportunities devotedly and wisely.

  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Time is both matter and energy. Again, it is beyond both matter and energy. When we aspire, time is nothing short of energy. When we do not aspire, time is nothing other than matter. And when we realise God, time is beyond both matter and energy.

  :cite-key: ADTD:62
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Yes, time can be wasted in the spiritual life. Every act, small or large, not only can be, but is significant, for each action is either taking us nearer to God or taking us farther from God.

* Question: Do past, present and future occur simultaneously, or do they progress linearly?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: ADTD:67
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ In the outer world of sound they progress linearly. But the past, the present and the future occur simultaneously in the inner world of Silence. In the inner world of Silence they occur simultaneously because God the Vision and God the Reality are one.



* Question: Is there a point of transcendence where time ceases to exist?

  :PROPERTIES:

  :cite-key: ADTD:68
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Yes, earthbound time ceases to exist when a seeker becomes the song of Eternity’s self-transcendence. But Heaven-free time never ceases to exist, for its existence and God’s existence are at once birthless and deathless.



* Question: What is the inner relationship between time and soul?

  :PROPERTIES:

/Sri Chinmoy:/ Time is the seed; soul is the plant, tree, flower and fruit. Time is; soul becomes and transcends.



* Question: As a spiritual seeker, should I regard time as my friend or as my enemy?

  :PROPERTIES:

  :cite-key: ADTD:70
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ As a spiritual seeker, you should always regard time as a great friend of yours and always try to be worthy of your friendship with time. If you appreciate, admire and adore the illumining and perfecting capacity that time has to inspire you constantly, to increase your aspiration-flames and brighten your surrender-light, then you will run the fastest toward the ultimate Goal.



* Question: What use is time to the unaspiring man, seeker, advanced seeker and God-realised man?

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: qa

  :cite-key: ADTD:71
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ To the unaspiring man time is a plaything; to the seeker it is something that he counts upon; to the advanced seeker it is something that he longs to transcend; and to a God-realised man time is something he uses to manifest God in God’s own way.



* Question: I have a hard time being punctual. Is it so important to be punctual as long as things get done?

  :PROPERTIES:

  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ I am sorry that you find it difficult to be punctual. Punctuality in the spiritual life is of paramount importance. When God knocks at your door at a fixed hour, if you don’t respond to Him, you will not be able to run the fastest and dive the deepest and fly the highest at His Choice Hour. Naturally the sincere seeker in you will feel miserable that you have not pleased God at the appointed hour. Regularity is good; punctuality is far better. Along with regularity and punctuality, if there is aspiration, then that is by far the best.

/Sri Chinmoy:/ When we feed the ignorance and the unreal in us it is nothing but illusion. But when we feed the divine in us, the Supreme in us, with our heart’s ever-mounting cry, then time is real, absolutely real.

/Sri Chinmoy:/ AUM is God the Creator, God the Preserver and God the Transformer. God the Creator embodies time; God the Preserver reveals time; God the Transformer manifests time.
