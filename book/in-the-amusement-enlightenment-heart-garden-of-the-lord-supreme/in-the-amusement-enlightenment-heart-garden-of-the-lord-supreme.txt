My Lord Supreme,
You defeat me in everything.
Will You not allow me to defeat You

Please give me a longer life than You have.

My Lord Supreme,
They say that imagination is
the strongest power both in
Heaven and on earth.
Therefore, I do not know how
You can be taller, stronger
and deeper than my imagination.

My Lord Supreme,
When we are sick, we go to see a doctor.
Since, in Your case,
there is no doctor for You,
I wonder how You get cured
when You become sick?
I think, You enjoy remaining incurable,
as we, Your children,
enjoy remaining incorrigible.

My Lord Supreme,
My mother passed away a few months ago.
I cry and cry for her every day, every hour and every minute.
Can You not bring her back to me?
Can You not take me to her, wherever she is?
Can You not find a place halfway where my mother and I can meet together, at least for a few hours a day?
Since You perform countless miracles every day, can You not add one more?
I am sure it will not hurt You.

My Lord Supreme,
I am at the mercy
of life-force and death-force.
When I am in Heaven, after some time the life-force brings me down to earth to enjoy the power of sound. And when I am on earth, after some time the death-force pulls me up to Heaven to enjoy the beauty of silence.
Can You not find a third place for me where I can live permanently and independently and where I can be eternally beyond the hunger-satisfaction of both life-force and death-force?
