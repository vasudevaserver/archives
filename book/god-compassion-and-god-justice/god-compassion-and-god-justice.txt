And
God-manifesting
Reality.

Oneness
With the earth-consciousness
Shows me what I am not:

With God
Shows me what I am and who I am:
I am man and I am God-
Man preparing for realisation,
God preparing for manifestation.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

The Absolute in us remains mute
Because He does not want to be involved
In our sound-life --
The life that does not want to construct,
But wants to destroy.
The Absolute tells us He is in us and for us
Only when we sing the song
Of constant construction,
Not destruction.

Of Mother-Earth and Father-Heaven.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

Look in the mirror
And what you see in yourself,
Try to see in others.
If you see perfection in your life,
Then see perfection in others.
If you see imperfection in yourself
And forgive yourself for your imperfection,
Then try also to forgive others
Who have the same imperfection.
The experience of oneness
In darkness or light
Brings about harmony.

#+END_VERSE

A life of balance
You discover within yourself
The moment you tell Mother-Earth
"I am for you,"
And the moment you tell Father-Heaven:
"I am of you."
When you tell Earth
That you are for Earth
And when you tell Heaven
That you are of Heaven
Then you ensure a life of balance.

  :genre: poem
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: GCGJ:19
  :END:


#+BEGIN_VERSE

Because of its lack of wisdom,
A snake drinks milk
And emits poison.
Because of his vast wisdom,
A saint drinks poison
And offers milk.
This is wisdom in oneness,
Wisdom in perfection,
Wisdom in God-satisfaction.
All of us must act like a saint.

If we can cry with the human in us

When the divine in us smiles,
Then there is happiness.
Happiness is in identification;
Happiness is in oneness-reality.

True persistence is not and cannot be

Of one's continuous patience-light.
And in this patience-light
Man eventually realises
That he is the Truth supreme.

With my human friend,
I tried to build a cottage.
Alas, we failed.

There, everywhere,
For our oneness is our omnipresence.
And our omnipresence is
What God eternally has
And
What God eternally is.

In and through us.
When this beauty of our soul
Plays its role satisfactorily,
The beauty of the physical
Becomes divine, perfect and immortal.
