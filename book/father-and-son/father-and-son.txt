"Certainly, My son, My Divine Love Infinite is more than enough for you. Unfortunately, you and I are suffering from the same disease, eternally old disease. We want to be loved by our nearest and dearest ones. We want to be loved by our creations."

"Father, please tell me in a few words what love actually means."

Sri Chinmoy Kumar Ghose came to the United States from his native India in 1964. Born in Bengal in 1931, he attained spiritual maturity in an ashram in South India, where the twenty years prior to his departure for the West were devoted to intense spiritual disciplines. Upon receiving the Inner Command of the Absolute Supreme, he came to the West, bringing to this Hemisphere the radiant light of his unparalleled Realisation.

Spiritual seekers here have unhesitatingly recognised his towering spiritual stature which, combined with his sweet, loving and unassuming disposition, have drawn thousands of devotees to him since his arrival. Eleven Sri Chinmoy Centres, where disciples receive the Guru's loving personal instruction in Spiritual Philosophy and Yoga have been established in North America, Europe and the Orient. The Master's extensive lecture tours, covering major Universities and Spiritual Centres here and abroad (including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge (England), Dublin (Ireland), Glasgow (Scotland), Zurich (Switzerland), Paris (France), and Tokyo (Japan) ) have resulted in the initiation of over thirty Sri Chinmoy Meditation Centres at these schools. His World-wide Mission is reflected in microcosm in the United Nations Meditation Group, which meets weekly at the U.N. Centre for Religion to meditate with the Guru for world peace. (Sri Chinmoy was the only spiritual figure to be invited to address the World Youth Congress held by the United Nations in 1970.)

The remarkable literary gifts of this Great Master are as compelling as his personal presence, awakening infinite peace and joy in the hearts of all. His radiant message speaks clearly and with poetic beauty in each line he writes. Within these pages is reflected the brilliance of his Wisdom-Sun.
