My Lord,
Now that my love for You
Is strong once more,
And my faith in You
Is strong once more,
I have decided to address
All my petitions and supplications
To Your Lotus-Feet once more.

The Smiles of Your Eye.

My Lord,
You do know the depth

From the depth
Of my sincerity-heart.
My Lord, do You
Agree with me?
"My child, I do, I do."

#+BEGIN_VERSE

My Lord,
One day You inject
Elephant-confidence in me,
Next day You inject
Lion-confidence in me.
This way, alternately,
You give me
The elephant-lion-confidence
Early in the morning.
But, alas, as the day advances,
My confidence disappears.
I become an object
Of pity-insecurity.

All the time inwardly,
But I know You are the only One
To take notice of me,

To take care of me,

To tolerate me,
You are the only One
Who has not lost
Even an iota of hope
In me.

My Lord,
I admit that I have made
Most serious blunders
And I admit that my faults
Are innumerable.
That does not mean
That You cannot overlook
My faults.

If You cannot overlook my faults,
If You cannot forgive me,
How are You going to preserve
Your reputation that You are
The Compassion-Forgiveness-Lord
Of the fallen?

Happily and proudly.
