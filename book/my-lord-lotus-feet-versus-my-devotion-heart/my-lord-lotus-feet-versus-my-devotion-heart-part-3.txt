My Lord,
Whenever I tell You lies,
You immediately catch me.
But how is it when You tell me lies,
I cannot catch You?
"My child,
Here is the proof
That I am infinitely smarter
Than you are."

My Lord,
When I fall sick, You cure me,
And this happens quite often.
But when You fall sick,
I can never cure You.
"My child,
There are many things
That you can do,
But I cannot do."
My Lord,
Please name only one.
"My child,
You have established friendship,
Permanent friendship,
With ignorance-night,
A thing impossible for Me
To accomplish."

My Lord,
I am planning to write
My autobiography.
Do You have any objection?
"My child,
I do have an objection."
Why, my Lord, why?
"I shall be terribly jealous
Of you.
I want you to write
My Biography first."

Do You think

To write my biography?
"My child,
I shall write
An excellent biography
Of your life
The day you completely stop
Criticising Me."

My Lord,
You tell me to be careful
Of my ego.
It will destroy me.
My Lord,
When I extol You to the skies,
Will You not have the same fate?
"No, My child,
Long, long before you were born,
I completely destroyed My ego."

My Lord,
Be frank at least once
In Your lifetime!
It seems to me
That You are jealous
Of my mixing with ignorance.
"My child,
Why should I not be?
After all, you are My child.
I do have every claim
To have you only for Myself."

My Lord,
The more I satisfy You,
The more You demand.
Before You wanted from me
Only love, devotion and surrender.
Now You have added obedience.
If I start obeying You,
Then You will invent
Something more!
"My child,
You failed miserably
In your love-devotion-surrender-
Examination.
I want you to study
The obedience-course,
Which is abundantly easier."
And, my Lord,
If I fail in Your obedience-course,
Will You have something
Even easier?
"My child,
Yes, I will have something
For you
Easier than the easiest-
My last resort-
A sesquipedalian cane
And
An iron rod!"
My Lord,
Before You go that far,
I am immediately starting
My obedience-love-devotion-
Surrender-life.
I shall obey You
Most sincerely.
I shall start loving You
Most sincerely.
I shall devote myself
To Your service
Most sincerely.
I shall give You
My unconditional surrender
Most sincerely.
"Then, My child,
Come, come, come
And sit beside Me
On My Golden Throne."

#+BEGIN_VERSE

My Lord,
When I do anything wrong,
You immediately scold me
Ruthlessly.
But when I do many things right-
I mean, most satisfactorily-
You do not say even one word
Of appreciation.
Is it fair?
"My child,
When you do things
To My great Satisfaction,
I am all admiration for you.
But, alas, your giant pride
Does not understand My language.
What is worse, it deafens
Your two long and beautiful ears.
"My child,
At that time you should sympathise
With Me,
Instead of finding fault with Me.
"My child,
I do hope
I have defended My case
Most honourably
And most satisfactorily."
My Lord,
In that case,
I am terribly sorry for You.
Or, should I say,
I surrender completely
And unconditionally
To Your inscrutable Cleverness.

My Lord,
I try so hard to please You,
But I can never please You.
Therefore, what is the use
Of trying again and again,
Only to fail again and again?
"My child, do not give up!
Let us not give up.
It is a joint effort.
The moment you succeed,
I shall succeed as well.
Your success has to precede Mine."

My Lord,
No matter how hard I try,
No matter how many ways
I kill myself to please You,
I can never please You.
Now it has come to a point
That I am arguing with myself
Whether I should continue trying
To please You.
Is it really worthwhile?
"My child,
I am sharing a top secret with you.
I have been also doing
The same thing.
You have no idea how hard
I have been working
To make you happy.
Alas, it is of no avail.
But something within Me
Is telling Me to continue,
So I shall continue.
And I am requesting you
To do the same.
I am sure there will come a time
When both of us will succeed.
As you know, our philosophy
Is never to give up.
So before long,
We are bound to succeed."

My Lord,
What do You think of astrology?

In My case

To go backward
In order to go forward.
I want only to go forward-
Faster than the fastest
And farther than the farthest."

My Lord,
Five days a week we work;
Two days we get rest.
Similarly, in the spiritual life,
Can we not pray and meditate
Five days a week
And two days enjoy rest?
"My child,
I have no idea
Whether you get a salary
On the days you do not work.
But in My case I cannot afford
To give you your salary
The days you do not work for Me."
My Lord,
What is Your salary, after all?
"My child,
My salary is
My Affection, My Love,
My Gratitude and My Pride."

Your heavy responsibility.
You may not believe Me,

To console whom?
Now, I am serious, My child-

I do not know why
You become so sad
When You see me.
Is it because You are not satisfied With me,
Or is it because of something else?

Not because you are not good,
But because your visits
Are quite infrequent
And unreliable."

From the disobedient human beings.
Needless to say, you top the list!"
