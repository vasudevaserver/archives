#+BEGIN_VERSE

Let us pray to God to grant us the capacity,
Out of His infinite Bounty,
To sleeplessly serve
    the peace-aspiring world.
Let us pray to God
To give us the most beautiful face
Of a oneness-world-family.
Let us pray to God
To give us the most powerful heart
Of a oneness-world-home.

A long twenty-three years ago my Beloved Supreme Absolute brought me to America to be of most soulful service to Him in the West. He blessed me with His infinite Hope, infinite Inspiration and infinite Aspiration to serve Him in the West.

You are my sweet children. You are my service-plants. You will one day become huge banyan trees. I am not only helping you; I will make you realise the Absolute Supreme and I will manifest Him in and through you at His choice Hour.

You are my choice children. With you and in you I see the perfection of humanity's heart and life. Love the Supreme in me infinitely more. Be devoted to the Supreme in me infinitely more. Lo, yours will be the sleepless joy and breathless satisfaction. Yours will be the complete perfection that humanity has been longing for centuries and centuries.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

As your spiritual Father,
I am crying and I shall be crying
Inside your minds for Illumination,
Inside your lives for Liberation,
Inside your hearts for Realisation,
Inside your souls for your attainment
Of God's ever-transcending Vision,
Inside your Inner Pilot for His sleepless,
Birthless and deathless Satisfaction
In you and through you.

I love my Beloved Supreme only,
Not because He has done
So many things for me unconditionally,
But because He is my life's only Hunger,
My heart's only Meal,
My soul's only Satisfaction
And my birthless and deathless
Eternity's All.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

My Lord Beloved Supreme,
It is now so clear to me that
You do not care for me.
My Lord, You do not care for me.
Is it because my mind is insincere?
Is it because my heart is impure?
Is it because I criticise You
Inwardly and outwardly every day?
Or are there some other reasons
Why You do not care for me?

"My child, if it is true that
I do not care for you,
Then it is not because of
your mind's insincerity,
Not because of your heart's impurity,
Not because of your cruel criticism of Me,
But because you dare to live
And do succeed in living
Without My Heart's Compassion,
Love, Blessing and Light."

#+BEGIN_VERSE

My mind tells me that my heart
Is not a sincere God-lover.
My heart tells me that my mind
Can never be transformed
And will never be transformed.
But my Lord Supreme is secretly telling me
That both my mind and my heart
Are totally mistaken.
He is telling me that my heart
Is definitely a sincere God-lover,
And that my mind will before long
Be transformed --
Amazingly transformed
And unimaginably transformed.

My sisters and brothers,

I keep dreaming, dreaming and dreaming God-Dreams sleeplessly.

I have lost my mind's purity.
That means I have lost much.
I have lost my heart's faith.
That means I have lost more.
I have lost my love of God.
That means I have lost all,
I have lost everything.
I have lost God the powerful Creator.
I have lost God the beautiful creation.
My Lord, my Lord, my Lord,
Do tell me how I can regain
my mind's purity,
My heart's faith and my love of You.

"My child, go and sing inside
your heart-garden.
You will regain your mind's purity.
My child, go and play with the
blue-gold child
Inside your heart.
You will regain your heart's faith.
My child, go and meditate with the breath
Of your newly-acquired
blue-gold child-friend.
You will regain your love for Me."

I shall not forgive them so easily.
