In this incarnation of mine:
Every morning and every evening
I wish to wash
Your Infinity's Compassion-Feet
With my heart's gratitude-tears.

My Absolute Lord Supreme,
Is there any special way
To please You in Your own Way
At every moment of my life?
"My sweet child,
There is a way, there is a way.
Just give Me your obedience-
Cheerful obedience
And soulful obedience,
Oneness-obedience
And fulness-obedience.
Lo, you have the capacity
And you are the capacity
To please Me in My own Way
At every moment of your life."

To breathe in the sweet fragrance
Of sacred remembrance.
