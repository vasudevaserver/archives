* Question: What would be the best way to calm the restless and unruly vital?[fn:: MHOF 1. Midtown Plaza Hotel, Cebu City, 8 January 1993.]

/Sri Chinmoy:/ Restlessness takes you away from your Source. Restless people will never be pleased; nothing will ever give them joy. There is a very effective way to calm the restless vital, and that is with the poise of the soul. The soul's poise is like the bottom of the Pacific Ocean -- very still and very deep. Each individual has the soul's poise. In my case, my soul's poise is my absolutely best quality.

You have many good qualities, but your best quality is your heart's golden luminosity. When you see something luminous, you get tremendous joy. The heart's luminosity can also calm the restless vital. As soon as luminosity enters into the vital, the restless vital becomes the dynamic vital. Each and every seeker needs a dynamic vital; it is of supreme importance. If you can enter into the heart and bring forward your golden luminosity, then your restless vital will become dynamic. Or if you can bring to the fore the soul's poise, the soul's poise will act immediately -- like magic.

The most important thing in our spiritual life is the soul. It is the only thing that keeps us connected to our Lord Supreme. You may not be able to see it or feel it, but it exists. The soul knows no barriers. It is beyond time and space; it is eternally free. It carries our Immortality. To grow into the light of the soul and fulfil the soul is to please the Supreme in His own Way.

Unfortunately, there are many seekers for whom the soul has no reality. It has no reality for them because they do not value it. If you value the existence of the soul, then you are bound to feel it and one day see it. If we give utmost importance to the soul, then all our problems will be solved. The more we can give conscious importance to the soul, the faster will the burdens of our body, the restlessness of our vital, the impurity of our mind and the insecurity of our heart be eliminated. This is true for each and every God-seeker.

Have faith in your soul. If you repeat "I am the soul," all the negative, unaspiring qualities of your body, vital, mind and heart -- everything that is standing in your way -- will have to surrender. All the imperfections of your inner and outer existence will drop away, for there cannot be any negative forces or imperfections in the soul.




* Part II[fn:: MHOF 2-5. These questions asked by Ursula Aznar-Schoeler and her family were answered by Sri Chinmoy during a visit to their jewellery factory in Talisay, Cebu, on 10 January 1993.]

* Question: I once saw a picture in my mind of a sword and a snake. The image keeps coming back to my mind as if it wants to make sure that I don't forget it. Can you tell me the spiritual significance? 

 :PROPERTIES:

 :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ What was your feeling while looking at the snake?

/Answer:/ I felt inner peace and a kind of joy, but afterwards confusion entered.

/Sri Chinmoy:/ Was the snake black or grey, or was it red or another colour?

/Answer:/ It was coloured.

/Sri Chinmoy:/ In your case, the snake represents dynamic life-energy. In India we have a cosmic god whose function on earth is to transform human beings. There are quite a few snakes around his neck. If the snakes are coloured, they represent dynamic energy. This dynamic energy constantly gives us new hope and new promise and also protects us from doing wrong things.

The body, by nature, is lethargic, idle; it does not want to move. But if there is dynamic energy inside the body, then immediately the body starts functioning. We get up, we walk, we run, we do many things for our lives.

The vital can be restless. This restlessness is not good, we all know. At every moment we are only shaking our life-tree. But if dynamic energy is flowing up to the top and then coming back down, if energy is percolating throughout the entire life-tree, then each and every branch of the life-tree will be full of strength and vigour, and the life-tree will produce most beautiful flowers and fruits.

If dynamic energy is flowing in the heart, then loneliness, depression and frustration will disappear, because the life-river is flowing and flowing, murmuring, running towards the vast ocean which is all dynamism on the surface and peace at the bottom. On the surface, the ocean is all waves and surges, but underneath it is all peace. Similarly on the outside, the life-energy is very dynamic, but the source of this energy is poise, inner silence.

When you see a sword surrounded with dynamic life-energy, you have to know that this sword is not for destruction as such, not to kill human beings, but to destroy the ignorance that each human being has hidden inside him. So this sword has to be used to destroy the ignorance inside you and inside others. This is the sword of a divine soldier who is trying to destroy the things that are preventing us from becoming good citizens of the world and perfect instruments of God. The sword is destroying the ignorance that is not allowing us to proceed, to dive deep within and to fly high, higher, highest, and the snake is the cosmic energy that is liberating us from our imperfections.



* Question: Could you say something about the role of Mother Mary?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: MHOF:3
 :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ The role of Mother Mary is unique. From the seed we get the plant, the tree, the flowers and the fruits. The Mother of the Saviour was responsible for the vision, aspiration and realisation of Her Son. Her silent prayer helped the Son considerably. Whenever we see the baby Christ with Mother Mary, immediately we feel that the beauty and fragrance of the creation, of Mother-Earth, are embodied inside the child. Or we can say that Mother-Earth has given everything that she has and that she is to the child, the Christ.

All the divine qualities of the Divine Mother, Mother Mary has, but Her Compassion aspect always comes to the fore. Inside Her Compassion is Her Forgiveness, and inside Her Forgiveness is Wisdom. When She forgives, it is not like ordinary forgiveness. With ordinary forgiveness, even after we are forgiven, again we start doing the same thing wrong. But when Mother Mary forgives us, She also gives us the message of wisdom, so that we do not repeat our mistake. She is always ready to help the individual who is not doing the right thing with Her Wisdom-Light.

When we think of God, especially in the Christian world, we feel that He is taller than the tallest -- infinitely taller than the Himalayas -- or far above us somewhere in Heaven. When we pray to God our Father who is in Heaven, we feel that if we pray and pray, someday we may be able to touch the Feet of God. It is difficult for us to immediately feel His Heart. We feel His Protection aspect or His Power aspect. But when we pray to Mother Mary, we immediately feel Her Heart. When we pray to God, we think of God the Omnipotent. With His Power He can destroy this old creation and build a new creation. With His Power He can also protect us. But when we pray to Mother Mary, immediately we feel the presence of God the Compassion. Her Compassion is inside Her Heart and nowhere else.

People who love God as Mother Mary feel that their prayers immediately enter into Her Heart. There Her Compassion, Her Affection, Her Love, Her Concern, Her constant Self-Offering to mankind can be felt. When we think of Mary, we feel that inside Her Heart She is feeding us, nourishing us with Her Affection, Compassion, Love, Concern and sleepless Self-Giving. She is always showing Her Affection and Compassion for those who consciously want to be Her special children. We are all Her children, but some want to be conscious children of Mother Mary. They are very fortunate because they consciously want to remain inside Her Heart and be nourished and fed with Her divine Nectar at every moment in their life of prayer, in their life of aspiration and in their life of dedication.



* Question: I have gone through so many hardships in trying to build up my business here. I almost went bankrupt; somebody stole so much from us and the place was destroyed by a typhoon. Do we have to go through those experiences so that we will become stronger or did we do something wrong on the way?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa

 :cite-key: MHOF:4
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ From the outer point of view, life is a constant struggle; we are constantly in the battlefield of life. Everybody goes through hardship in order achieve something, in order to arrive at the destination. If God has infinite Compassion, and if we are His children, why do we have to go through such hardship? He has everything; He has infinite Wealth. Can He not give us everything free of charge? Can He not inundate our lives with His Riches: love, light and prosperity?

The question we have to ask ourselves is: are we trying to be really happy? Are we longing for the happiness that will last forever and at the same time transcend and transcend, that will increase in infinite measure? Many, many times in the ordinary life, when parents are extremely rich and children do not have to do anything, the children misuse their parents wealth. Because they have got everything at their disposal, they do not value anything.

Similarly, God can give us everything, but we will not value it. Let us say you bring the most beautiful flower from the Philippines and give it to your daughter. First she will observe it, and then perhaps she will wonder how this flower has come into existence, how its petals were born. Some restless forces in her will compel her to examine it like a doctor or a scientist. She will start pressing and pulling the petals, and soon the whole flower will be ruined. Some forces inside her will not allow her to only appreciate, admire and grow into the beauty and fragrance of the flower.

If she had created the flower, if she had been responsible for sowing the seed and had waited for months to see the product of her seed, then she would never think of destroying the flower. She would try to become one with the beauty and fragrance of the flower. She would say, "Oh, how I wish I could become as pure, as beautiful, as lovely, as divine as the flower."

In our lives, many, many times we encounter hardships. Why? So that we will value the divinity within us that is compelling us, urging us to move forward, to fly upward, to dive deep within every day, consciously, soulfully and self-givingly to increase our divine qualities. God is always helping us. If we play our own role in this divinely ordained task, then we feel that we are worthy to be the choicest children of our Absolute Lord Supreme. That is why we go through these so-called hardships.

When we go deep within, we feel that it was not actually we who suffered while going through these hardships. Somebody else acted and suffered in and through us. We just became the witness. When we feel that we are the doer, we suffer so much. But when our consciousness goes higher, it becomes clear to us that God is the only Doer who performs every action in order to become the divinely supreme Enjoyer of His creation.



* Question: Is it possible for spirits speaking through mediums to falsely claim that they are this or that spiritual figure? Are spirits speaking through mediums genuine, false or mixed?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: MHOF:5
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ At times they are genuine. At times they are just a mixture of human feelings. Sometimes our imagination is very strong. Sometimes we are drinking pure milk and sometimes we put powder in water and it looks so white that we feel it is real milk.

There are good spirits and evil spirits. Sometimes good spirits may not be as strong as the bad spirits. So we have to be careful. Suppose there are two sisters. One is very pure, always tells the truth and does the right thing. The other one is very naughty and destructive. The parents have given the same freedom to both daughters, but they exercise their freedom in different ways. One is ready to go to church, to pray and to do the right thing to please the parents. The other one consciously does everything wrong. The ignorant one tries to punish or destroy the good one. So what will the parents do? They will consciously try to help the good sister. As soon as the good sister does something, they will give her a powerful smile which will strengthen her good qualities. The bad one will say, "Am I not also your daughter? Am I not her sister?" The parents will say, "No, what you are doing is wrong." Then the bad one will feel helpless. She will say, "If I don't act the way my sister is acting, I will be nowhere." The negative forces have to be taught by making the good forces stronger. You have to always consciously take the side of the good forces.

But sometimes our very human nature enjoys destruction. It takes two or three years or even more to build a house. Then we get joy in destroying that house or in seeing that house be destroyed. We have a special festival in Chittagong, in India. The villagers gather together and spend the whole day building a house. Then, in the evening, they set fire to the house and enjoy its destruction. They give the spiritual reason that creation and destruction must go together. That is the village way of thinking.

But we believe in the positive approach. From beauty we will try to get more beauty. From purity we will try to get more purity. From divinity we will try to get more divinity. If we take this approach, our bad qualities will eventually come to feel that they are not being appreciated and will go away. In the beginning it may be painful for us to separate our good qualities from our bad qualities. But if we walk only towards our goal, gradually all the wrong qualities or the burdens that we have been carrying will drop off because those heavy loads do not care for the destination that we have in mind.

So there are many spirits operating that are not at all divine. They are misleading and misguiding people. You have to be very, very careful when you go to mediums and pray to God, to the Saviour or to Mother Mary only to be connected with the good spirits. If you go there with the intention of being blessed and of increasing your divine qualities, then you have to be in touch only with the good spirits Consciously pray to the good spirits to keep you under their guidance and protection so that you will not in any way be in touch with the evil spirits.

* Question: When I make a resolution, how can I have the determination to follow through with it? 

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: MHOF:6
 :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Is there anybody on earth who does not have that problem? My older brother Mantu's resolution is that he will never, never read the newspaper; he feels it is a waste of time. Every year his New Year's resolution is that he will not read the newspaper because it is all falsehood. Then early in the morning a friend or relative will stop by and say, "Did you hear such and such?" That is enough for him! Then my brother goes to the library and spends an hour and a half reading the newspaper.

You can keep your resolutions only by not seeing the past. Let us say you have failed to keep a particular resolution many, many times. Do not think of how many times you have failed; that has no value. Do not feel that you have been studying and failing this particular subject for many years and that the teacher is giving you chance after chance to study it again. No, you have to feel that you are learning a completely new subject. The subject you are studying, which is self-discipline, you are starting right now for the first time. If you can feel this, then the number of times that you have failed will go away from your mind. Otherwise, each time you fail, the depression, frustration or sadness that you feel becomes a heavy load, an elephant that you have to carry on your shoulders. Look at how many heavy loads you have been carrying around in your mind all these years! That is one of the reasons you are finding it difficult to keep your resolutions.

Another thing you have to know is that our determination to keep a resolution never depends on personal effort. We can say we will do it by hook or by crook. But even that hook and crook will only accomplish one per cent; for the rest we have to depend on God's Grace. And if we are sincere, even that one per cent that represents our personal effort we will say is all due to God's Grace. If we set the alarm clock in order to get up early in the morning to pray and meditate, then we have to feel that God's Grace is operating in and through the alarm. It is also due to God's Grace that we were inspired to set the alarm the previous night. Here God's Grace is coming in the form of inspiration and wisdom. Everything positive that we do comes from a higher Source, which is God's Grace and God's Compassion. An athlete may feel that if he practises very hard, then he will become the world's fastest runner or strongest boxer. But it is not like that. There are many athletes who perhaps practise more than Carl Lewis. So how is it that he is becoming number one? It is because God's Grace is operating in and through him, and he is more receptive than others. No amount of practice is enough without God's Grace.

God is all the time exercising or expressing His own Capacity, Compassion and Grace through human beings. But most of the time we human beings are not grateful to God. We should be grateful to God that He has kept us on the path, that He keeps us from time to time thinking of Him, praying to Him and meditating on Him, that He inspires us to offer our goodwill to mankind. Because human beings are not grateful enough to God, He is unable to make progress in and through us. Every human being has a vessel into which God wants to pour His Nectar-Delight, His Compassion, His Blessings and His Divinity. But, unfortunately, because of our life of ingratitude, instead of enlarging the vessel every day, we are making it smaller.

Each day we should express our gratitude to God for what we are. No matter how bad we are, we could have been infinitely worse. People think, "How can I become worse? Have I not touched the rock bottom?" No, I tell you, if God wants to, He can make you infinitely worse. When we suffer physically, vitally or mentally, we feel that it is the height of suffering. But if God wants to experience infinitely more suffering in and through us, He can. When we are not one with God's Will, we feel that we are suffering and that God is indifferent. But when we become one with God's Will, we see that it is God who is suffering in and through us.

Right now you may not be able to see God. But you can certainly feel God's Presence. If you can feel God's Presence inside you, then you can mould and shape your life into a more receptive and perfect instrument of God.



* Question: You say that when we are suffering we should try to feel the presence of the Supreme. But one of the reasons human beings suffer is that we feel separated from the Supreme. So where does one begin that effort?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa

 :cite-key: MHOF:7
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ If you cannot think of the Supreme, then think of your physical mother or any relative or friend of yours with whom you have established a connection over the years. Since you were a child, there is bound to be someone with whom you have established your oneness. When you are suffering, imagine that individual is standing right in front of you.

I always say that imagination is a reality. The person you are imagining may not even be alive. When I suffer physically, mentally or in any way, immediately I see my physical mother right in front of me, although she is in the other world. You can say that in my case it is different because I have free access to my mother, but you definitely know someone who was most compassionate or most affectionate to you. The Supreme you may not know; you have not seen Him. But some other person you have seen many, many times in your life. If that particular person who has been so compassionate and affectionate stands in front of you, then I tell you, that person will in no way suffer less than you are suffering.

When disciples who have a close connection with me suffer physically or mentally, at that time I suffer much more than they do. Outwardly I may give a smile or just say, "Everything will be fine; it will go away." But afterwards, before I even take two steps, I enter into the soul of that person and do the needful. If the person has established a close connection with me, I may not look at that person again in order to show how sincerely concerned, sincerely caring and compassionate I am. But immediately I will work inside the soul and the heart of that person. At that time how much I suffer on their behalf!

So if you can imagine the presence of the person who is closest to you in front of you, sympathising with you with utmost sincerity, then definitely you will feel less pain. It may be more than one person; there may be ten or twenty individuals standing in front of you and sympathising with your suffering.

If somebody dies in your family and a few relatives come and sincerely try to console you, if they share your sufferings, your sorrows and your loss, then you feel much better. Some may not be able to come physically, but still you can remember them and know that if they were physically present, they would show the same kind of consolation, the same kind of oneness.



* Question: If you had known how things would turn out, would you still have accepted me as your disciple?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa

 :cite-key: MHOF:8
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ I would have accepted you even if you were infinitely worse. Also, if you become infinitely worse, I shall still keep you. No matter where you go, I will be with you. But if you wish to be a true God-seeker, then every day, every hour and every minute you will try to lead a better life. You have to know the value of God's Smile and the value of His Sadness. When you do something, try to imagine God's smiling Face or His sad Face. If you do not want to see His Sadness, then many bad things you will not do. And if you value His Happiness, then the good things that you do you will increase. You will say, "This makes God happy, so let me do it ten times, twenty times, fifty times."



* Question: What is the secret of perfect manifestation?

/Sri Chinmoy:/ The secret of manifestation is constant, cheerful self-giving minus jealousy and minus insecurity.



* Question: Do we come back with the same body, vital and mind?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: MHOF:10
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ No, we do not come back with the same body, vital and mind. But if the body, vital and mind are very, very pure, extremely, extremely pure, then the quintessence of that purity can enter into the heart. And if the heart is pure, then the quintessence of the heart's purity can enter into the soul and be preserved. The physical body that we take will never be the same in the next incarnation. When we die, the physical consciousness, vital consciousness and mental consciousness we have to leave at different places. The soul does not take them with it when it goes up to the higher worlds. But if you have done something very, very good, then the essence or quintessence of your achievement can enter into the higher realities along with the soul.



* Question: How can I have sweetness in my singing?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: MHOF:11
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ For the most haunting voice, for a soft, delicate, sweet quality in the voice, you have to open the throat chakra.

In some cases it does not come from the throat chakra. There are some world-famous singers who will get zero in the spiritual world because their singing comes from the navel chakra. The vital also can have a very subtle, delicate feeling, but the capacity of the vital is limited. It may last for 20, 30, 40 or 50 years, but at the end of the life of that particular singer, it will end.

But if somebody can bring the very subtle, delicate, sweet, soulful quality from the throat chakra, then it lasts forever. Not only that, it helps to raise the consciousness of mankind. Many famous singers touch the vital of others, but they are never going to raise the consciousness of any human being, not to speak of their own consciousness. Millions of people may appreciate these singers, but they are appreciating their songs from the vital plane. Because the vital and the heart are very close to each other, sometimes we feel that the heart is also getting joy when the vital is excited. No, the heart is not getting anything. But if the music comes from the throat chakra, the body, vital, mind, heart and soul will all benefit.

There is also another way to make your voice sweeter. While singing, try to think of your heart. As soon as you start singing the first line, try to feel that something is coming out from your heart into the song. Try to sing each line from the heart. Or while you are singing, feel that not only the melody but the words are coming through your nostrils. While you are singing, you are opening your mouth, but each and every word is passing through your nostrils because the life-breath is going out from there. Where the life-breath is coming in and going out there is tremendous sweetness.



* Question: How do we know if we are pleasing God?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: MHOF:12
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ We can easily know if we are pleasing God, because there will be a cheerful feeling not only inside our heart but also inside our thoughts. Inside the heart there will be something at every moment that will make us feel that we are doing the right thing, and this will give us happiness. At the same time, encouraging and inspiring thoughts will come into our mind and give us satisfaction. So if we get satisfaction inside our heart and inside our thoughts, then we can know that we are pleasing God. Real satisfaction does not come from the pleasure-life. It only comes from pleasing God in His own Way.



* Question: Did God give us short memories so that we don't know why we are getting certain karma from previous incarnations?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: MHOF:13
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ God has done us a big favour by giving us short memories because if we remember what we have done wrong, then we will feel even more miserable. The result of our undivine actions is painful enough in itself. If we start thinking of the karma that caused this result, it becomes even more painful.

After a thorn has been removed from your foot, even then your foot may be hurting you. But if you actually saw the thorn while it was still inside your foot, the very image of the thorn would give you more suffering. You would think, "Oh my God, such a destructive thing!" Or suppose you step on a piece of glass. If the image of that sharp piece of glass flows before your mind, then even though it has been removed, you will suffer more because you know the cause of your suffering.

If we forget the thing that originally created the problem for us, then we decrease our suffering by almost half. We get whatever punishment we deserve, but because we do not remember the actual event that led to our punishment, our suffering is less.



* Question: Will our universe become a black hole when the universe ends?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: MHOF:14
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ The universe can never be destroyed. Let us use the term 'world'. The world is such a vast place. No matter how many bombs are dropped, total destruction cannot take place. But if someone has dropped a bomb and destroyed my house, then in my mind my whole world is gone. We use the term 'world' according to our mental conception.

As long as God wants to keep His creation, the whole universe will not be destroyed. A portion may be destroyed, but if we see that portion with our inner eye, we will see that it is an infinitesimal portion of the entire reality, which we call the universe. A few mischievous boys may play with fireworks and destroy their own house or a few houses around them, but there are millions and billions of houses, and they cannot destroy all of them. In Japan, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed, but Japan is not the whole world. Again, Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been reborn. They have now become sacred peace shrines.

This world will never end, because inside the world is God's own Vision, God's own Hope, God's own Promise. If a potter creates a few vessels, a mad animal may for no reason come and destroy some of the vessels. But the potter can easily create more. God is the Creator. At every second he can create a new world.

From the spiritual point of view, if people are not aspiring, if people are living only in the desire-world, then you can call it the destruction of our aspiration. But the physical universe cannot be destroyed at any particular time.



* Question: How can we work quickly without tension?

 :PROPERTIES:

  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Tension is in the mind, nowhere else. Inside the heart there is no tension. Even inside the knees or legs there is no tension; there is only pain. Real tension is inside the mind.

Tension goes away to a great extent if you can breathe in and out very slowly. If you can imagine that you are taking one full minute to breathe in and another full minute to breathe out, even though in reality it may not be true that you are taking that long, then your tension is bound to be released.



* Question: How can I lose weight?

  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Somebody went to a doctor and asked how to lose weight. The doctor said, "Eat as much as you can for as long as you can."

The person said, "Then how am I going to lose weight?"

The doctor said, "If you eat too much, then you are not going to get up. You will just lie in bed all the time. Then you won't go to work and your boss will fire you. If your boss fires you, you will have no money to buy food. Then automatically you will lose weight!"

To lose weight, do not have a long-range goal. Say you have to lose forty pounds. Never think of forty pounds. Only think of five pounds as your goal. You cannot climb up the Himalayas overnight.



* Question: How can the vacation consciousness last all year?

 :PROPERTIES:

  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ So many things you have done during your vacation which have given you joy. Write down these incidents and each day remember one of them. Each day if you can bring to the fore one incident which gave you happiness on your vacation, then that same consciousness, that same happiness, will pervade your whole year.



* Question: How can I find my spiritual role?

 :PROPERTIES:

 :cite-key: MHOF:18
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ You have already found it. Once you accept the spiritual life, that life itself is your role. The two cannot be separated. You can say that once you accept the spiritual life, still you have to do something outwardly. It is true that you can excel in some earthly career, but your real career is your spiritual career. Your spiritual life is your main role. Your role is to love and serve God in God's own Way. So the day you accepted the spiritual life, your spiritual role started.



* Question: How can I minimise my working time?

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa
 :keywords:
 :cite-key: MHOF:19
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ I know that in your case you work for twelve or fifteen hours every day. You want to minimise your working time because you have other, more important things to do than to be in your office or your studio all the time.

On the practical plane you have to get more workers who will be efficient in running your business. You have to train some people to such an extent that your physical presence is not needed. You not only have to train them, but you also have to have confidence in them. If they make mistakes, you have to forgive them and sympathise with them. If they do something wrong, you have to say, "Perhaps I would also have made that mistake had I been in their place." You have to train them with utmost concern and utmost compassion. If you train these people and show them utmost concern and compassion, and if you have oneness with them, you will easily be able to minimise your working time so that you can do more important things. Meanwhile, those whom you have trained will be able to do the work without your physical presence because they will have your inner guidance.

/Sri Chinmoy:/ In addition to our bad qualities, each human being has many, many good qualities. The most important and most significant good quality in our human life is gratitude. Unfortunately, that good quality we somehow manage not to express either in our thoughts or in our actions. Right from the beginning of our life we have somehow learned not to express it. So we have the least amount of the very thing that we need most in order to become a better person.

The things that most deserve our gratitude we just take for granted. Without air we cannot live for more than a minute or two. Every day we are breathing in and breathing out, but do we ever feel grateful to the air? If we do not drink water, we cannot survive. Even our body is composed to a large extent of water. But do we give any value to water? Every morning when we open our eyes, we see the sun blessingfully offering us light and life-energy, which we badly need. But are we grateful to the sun? On the contrary, when the sun is too bright we get mad and complain that it is bothering us. The sun is like the mother who gives food to the child so that he can remain alive on earth. But the child quite often gets annoyed at the mother for bothering him. In India we have many gods and goddesses, and even a particular god to whom we offer gratitude. The Western world has many saints. But do we offer these gods or these saints our gratitude?

Every day there are so many people to whom we should offer gratitude. Someone did me this favour. Someone else did me that favour. There is no end to the number of individuals to whom we have to offer our gratitude. If we try to offer gratitude to each individual, it becomes impossible. But no individual created himself. We were all created by God, our Heavenly Father. He is our Source. So if we are not able to offer gratitude to everyone who deserves it from us, we can at least offer gratitude to the Source.

A tree has many branches and countless leaves, flowers and fruits. If we try to offer our gratitude to the millions of leaves, people will say, "You are a fool!" We will get tired just counting the branches, not to speak of the leaves, flowers and fruits. But the tree came from a tiny seed, and the Source of that seed is God. He is the Source of everything in the creation. So if we offer our gratitude to the Source, we are doing the right thing.

From our early morning prayer and meditation we receive good thoughts. Some people will have hundreds of good thoughts. For them to try to offer gratitude to each thought would be ridiculous because they have to go to work, they have to do this, they have to do that. We know that if we can offer gratitude to anything good that comes to us early in the morning, then many good things will happen in our life. We will do good things for others and they will do good things for us. So how can we offer gratitude to our good thoughts? It is by offering gratitude to their Source, our Heavenly Father, for He is the One who has come to us in the form of good thoughts. Everything that comes to us in the form of goodness comes from God.

So at every moment we have to offer our sincere gratitude to the Source, because we will not be able to offer gratitude to each individual, each thought, each action. Today I have received a fax from Tomsk, Russia, informing me that they plan to teach my philosophy at the university there. God alone knows who the President of the university is, who the faculty members are who are responsible, who the secretary is who typed the fax. If I try to imagine what each of them looks like and then offer my gratitude, it will be a joke. But He who blessingfully inspired these people -- the President, the faculty members, the university and the country -- is the One to whom I can easily offer my soulful gratitude. As soon as I read the fax this morning, I offered gratitude to my Inner Pilot Supreme. Then, while I was reading out the fax to all of you, again I offered my gratitude to Him.

Of course, if we do have the opportunity to offer gratitude to a particular individual, wonderful! But even then what we are really doing is offering gratitude to the Source. Let us say that you do me a favour and I offer you my gratitude. At that time I am actually offering my gratitude to the Inner Pilot, the Source, in you -- to the Heavenly Father, who is in you, in me, in the entire creation. The One who deserves my gratitude is not you, but God, our Heavenly Father. He is the very Person who came to you in the form of a good action, and He is the One who is inspiring me to offer you my gratitude. In everything He is the Doer; we are only His instruments.

Outwardly we should try to offer as much gratitude as we can to those who are inwardly or outwardly helping us. I am not saying that we should not offer gratitude to someone if he does something good for us. Far from it! But if we do not have the time to offer our gratitude to everyone who does something for us, God will not blame us. If we cannot offer gratitude to someone individually, no harm. But we have to offer gratitude to the One who has inspired the creation in the form of this human being. To Him we have to offer gratitude. We may not have time to offer our gratitude to the entire creation, but we do have time to offer gratitude to God inside us.



* Question: Could you speak about growth, peace, luck and fulfilment?

 :PROPERTIES:

  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Another word for growth is progress. Something that is growing is making progress. In our spiritual life, we say that the most important thing is not success but progress. Anything that comes to us in life in the form of success will eventually give us dissatisfaction, because the glory and joy of success does not last. Our success lasts for five minutes; then immediately somebody is there to smash our pride. That is because success-life and rivalry or competition always go together. No matter how successful we are today, there will always be somebody to defeat us tomorrow. Success makes us feel that we have become something, but this thing we cannot keep. And when it goes away, it is very painful.

But if we care only for progress, then we are not competing with anybody. Yesterday, let us say, I wrote two nice poems, and today I have written four poems. So I am very happy because I am making progress. I am not competing with you; I am not asking you how many poems you have written. But if I feel a sense of rivalry with you and ask you how many poems you have written, and if you say, "Oh, I wrote ten poems," then all my joy goes away and I feel miserable. So all that matters in our spiritual life is progress. That is absolutely necessary.

The next idea you asked about is peace. Peace we do not get by having something; peace we get only by becoming something. You have a farm and so many possessions, whereas a poor man may have nothing. So people may say that you have peace whereas the poor man has no peace, since early in the morning he has to think of where he is going to get food for the day. But you have other problems. Your problem may not be to get a little bread and butter, but you have to think of your wife, your children, your dear ones. They may get sick or something else may happen. Although you may have many possessions, at every moment they may cause you worry and anxiety. You know in your heart of hearts how much suffering you go through. So where is your peace?

What you have to do is consciously feel that you are not the owner of your possessions. Somebody has given them to you to take care of, and that Somebody may also take them back. Since You are not the owner but only the keeper, you will not be upset if He asks for them back. If you can feel that God has entrusted you with some prosperity and that you are keeping it for Him, if you can feel that you are not the possessor but only the keeper, then you will have peace. If you can feel that you are only consciously and soulfully executing His Will according to your capacity, then you will definitely have peace.

When we feel that we are taking care of something for someone, we feel that we are an extension of that person. Peace comes when we extend ourselves. I was born in a tiny village in India. That was my whole world. Then I went to a spiritual community and my world got bigger. Then I came to New York, the capital of the world, and my world became even larger. Now I am travelling in the Philippines, here, there, everywhere, and establishing my prayerful oneness with all of these places. So in the beginning I was only part of a tiny village, but now my soul-bird is flying the length and breadth of the world. The life-tree is one, but it has many, many branches. Each country is like a branch, an extension of the life-tree, and the bird is flying from this branch to the next. In this way I am expanding myself and becoming one with the whole world. When I am one with the whole world, who is there to take away my peace? At that time I have become peace itself.

You have asked about luck. There is no such thing as luck or fortune. Whenever there is luck, we have to know that in the inner world something has taken place. Luck comes in the form of the sea or the ocean, but a long stream or a long river has brought us to the ocean. When we reach the ocean, we feel that we are lucky, but we do not see that the life-river which carried us there is very, very long.

Everything comes from the inner world because of something we did either in this incarnation or in some previous incarnation, either twenty years ago or two hundred years ago. We believe in reincarnation. We feel that this is not our first or our last incarnation. If we want to please God and fulfil God, we need more than a single lifetime. Thousands and thousands of years are needed to do God's work properly. So what someone may call luck is actually the result of something good we have done.

Luck may also come from the good thoughts and good wishes of your friends and dear ones. You have so many friends. You cannot think of them all at the same time, but they all can easily think of you at the same time. If ten of your friends or dear ones are thinking of you with very pure, divine thoughts and offering you their love, affection and compassion, a solid inner power is being accumulated. It may seem that all of a sudden you are lucky. But you have no idea how many people have sent you goodwill at that very moment. You are getting the result, but you do not know the source. Again, the reason they are thinking of you with such goodwill is because you did them a favour either yesterday or many years ago. So luck is the result of something you have done in a previous incarnation or the accumulated result of things that you or your dear ones have done in this incarnation.

The last thing you asked about is fulfilment. We have to take fulfilment as happiness; there is no other way to think of it. Ordinary human happiness comes only when we get something that we wanted, when we are pleased in our own way. Let us say you want to be a very strong person. So you become strong and you are happy. But then you see that others are making fun of you because they are stronger. Or you see that although your body is strong today, it becomes weak tomorrow. This moment it has no ailments; the next moment it catches cold or gets a stomach upset. Then you cannot get up in the morning; you cannot talk to people. You are miserable. So for one moment this body gives you joy, and then for weeks or months it makes you miserable. This is the way everything happens in our life: we get something and then it is taken away. We get it for five seconds; then for five days or five months it is gone. When we get what we want, we are happy, and our happiness lasts for a fleeting second. When what we wanted is gone, we are miserable for a long time.

But there is another way of getting happiness -- the way of surrender. The most powerful prayer in God's entire creation was uttered by the Saviour Christ: "Let Thy Will be done." There cannot be any prayer higher than this. He said, and everywhere on earth people have come to realise, that only by pleasing God in God's own Way can we be happy. Otherwise, we will keep the bird inside the cage for a few minutes, and then the bird will fly away. So if we want happiness, we have to change our attitude. We have to say, "It is God who brought the bird and gave me the inspiration and capacity to put it in the cage. And it was God who took the bird away from me." At every moment let us think of the Source -- that God gave us something and that God took it away.

When our dear ones leave us, we have to feel that He who created them and who loves them infinitely more than we do, did what is best for them. Then we are happy. God's Love for His creation is infinitely greater than our love. God's Love for our dear ones is infinitely greater than our love for them. The potter has created a vessel with inspiration, affection and love. When we see the pot, we just grab it and break it. But he who created this vessel with such concern, such affection and such self-giving will never act like this.

God gave you [referring to Elias T.] your wife twenty-eight years ago out of His boundless Compassion. She existed before she married you, and now also she exists in the soul's world; she is in Heaven. It is as though while walking somebody comes and joins me for twenty-eight miles. After that, I become tired or the other person starts going faster. If I love that person, I will say, "You go according to your own speed. I am tired now; I have to take a little rest. Then, when my time comes, again I will run fast." So happiness comes by allowing the other person to go ahead if the person has the capacity and wants to go ahead. You have to surrender to God's Will and feel, "I will go in my own time. When my hour strikes, at that time I also will go to God."

Your wife was with you for twenty-eight years and now she is gone. But you have to know that for many years you did exist without her and now also you exist. If you care for that person, you have to feel, "The One who asked her to be in this room for a while has now taken her to another room. It is His House, His Mansion. He was the One who brought that person and He is the One who has taken her, so what right do I have to object?" Only by surrendering to God's Will can we get happiness. Otherwise, if we try to possess, we are miserable; if we are possessed, we are also miserable. True happiness, true fulfilment, lies only in becoming one with God's Will. There is no other way we can get fulfilment.



* Part IV[fn:: MHOF 22-27. On 22 January 1993, Sri Chinmoy met with Dr. Hubert Reynolds, Professor of Peace Studies at Silliman University, at the South Seas Resort Hotel in Dumaguete. These are excerpts from their conversation.]

/Sri Chinmoy:/ The life-tree has many branches. Some branches are large while others may be smaller than the smallest. But they belong to the same life-tree. Because we love the tree, we love all the branches. If we don't care for our little brothers, then why should our big brothers care for us?



* Professor Reynolds: We appreciate you coming at this time. The whole peace process is so important.

 :PROPERTIES:

  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ Everything in life has failed us or will eventually fail us if we do not achieve peace. We are running after success-life. But success can never give us joy because there is always somebody who is more successful than we are. If I become great in something, immediately I will see somebody who is greater.

When we live in the success-world, we are always competing with others; so we are always at the mercy of others. But when we care only for progress, we are not at anyone's mercy. We are only climbing up our own life-tree; we only want to transcend our own capacities. We have an inner urge to become a better person and a better citizen of the world, not by hook or by crook, but by sincere diligence.

So if we really want abiding satisfaction in our individual life and in our collective life, then we have to give paramount importance not to success but to progress, inner and outer. It is not that we are being self-centred. Only we feel that if we do not find inner peace and inner happiness, then everything else will have been in vain.



* Professor Reynolds: How long have you been conducting these peace programmes?

 :PROPERTIES:

  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ I am a student of Socrates. He said "I am not an Athenian. I am a cosmopolitan." In my case also, I have come to serve the world. In 1964 I came to America from India. Then, in 1970 I started conducting meditations twice a week at the United Nations for the delegates and staff members who are interested in the spiritual life. There we also honour different countries, because we feel that each country has a soul and this soul is the direct representative of God. So we honour the different countries and try to bring to the fore their soul's qualities.

I have gone to many places and given talks on spirituality. Nineteen years ago I came to Silliman University and gave a talk at the Medical College. Doctors and nurses asked me questions, and I told them that spirituality and medical science are not enemies because their goals are the same. Both the doctor and the spiritual seeker are trying to cure human suffering. So they should stand on the same side in the tug-of-war against imperfection-disease. If doctors and spiritual people all pull together, then they are bound to win. In a family somebody may be a doctor, somebody may be a lawyer and somebody may be an engineer; but all are members of the same family, and when necessity demands, all have to stand together against ignorance.

Over the years I have given many talks at universities, but I did not succeed to my satisfaction in bringing to the fore the consciousness of the seekers. Then I decided to give Peace Concerts; I didn't want to be a talker anymore. I wanted to be a man of spirituality and silence. We know that music is next to spirituality. So I play a number of musical instruments, and through music I try to offer peace. I cannot expect each and every individual to like the same thing. That is why I play a number of different instruments. I usually play about 20. My goal is to be of service to mankind, and I feel I am amply rewarded if I can be of inspiration to a few people on earth.



* Professor Reynolds: I have been teaching a seminar on world peace for about 12 years. I have come to realise that the United Nations is a hopeful organisation although it does need some changes. Since you have been close to the United Nations, maybe you could make some suggestions.

 :PROPERTIES:
 :genre: qa

 :cite-key: MHOF:25
  :END:


/Sri Chinmoy:/ I do not make any suggestions. I am a student of peace. I go there to offer my services through my prayers and meditation, and many come to pray and meditate with me. We have come to realise from our prayer and meditation that the human mind as such cannot solve any world problems. What is needed is the aspiring heart. As soon as we use our mind, doubt comes to the fore. If you doubt me and I doubt you, how can we do anything together? This moment my mind tells me you are a nice man, and the next moment my mind says you are not a nice man. But who is my mind to judge? By judging someone I am not enlightening or illumining him. It is only by loving someone, by claiming him as my own, very own, that I can transform and illumine him. It is like a parent and a child. When the child does something wrong, the parents don't say, "Oh, you are a bad fellow. Go away!" No! By virtue of their compassion, affection and love, they feel that the child's defect is their own and that it is their bounden duty to save and illumine him.

The mind wants only to enjoy supremacy. For the mind, peace is being one step ahead of someone else. But if I want to be one step ahead of you and you want to be one step ahead of me, how can we have peace? The heart wants only oneness. With my heartpower I will try to claim you as my own. With my heart-power I will seek not to be one step ahead of you, but to walk side by side with you. So it is only heart-power that will bring about world peace.

The heart has the message and capacity of identification; the heart is all oneness. We feel our heart is synonymous with a home; we speak of a oneness-home. We go to work in various walks of life and come back home for the evening, where we enjoy our oneness with our family, our world-family. For real peace to be achieved, we need eagerness and enthusiasm. Enthusiasm we need in our minds, eagerness we need in our hearts and soulfulness we need in our life.

Unfortunately, when nations meet together to discuss peace, they are using their mind-power. They are trying to solve their problems mentally, not psychically. That is why the problems are still there and will always be there. If we enter into a room that is unlit, then how can we get light? The mind-room is unlit, whereas the heart-room is getting light directly from the soul, which gets the light directly from God. So, from Above, the light is coming down to purify and illumine our life. The light has already entered into the heart. Next it will have to enter into the mind. From the mind it will enter into the vital and then into the body.

Again, we have to know that receptivity is of paramount importance. The morning sun is for everybody. But if I keep my doors and windows closed, then the sun will not be able to come in. Since you have kept your windows and doors open, the sunlight is coming in and illumining your room. You are getting fresh hope, new inspiration and new aspiration. But I am continuing in my darkness-life.

The human mind only sings the song of division. Because my left arm is weaker than my right, my mind gives all importance to my right arm. But I know that if I didn't have a left arm, then people would say, "Look, he is imperfect." Perfection can be found only in the totality, and what the heart does is accept and embrace the totality. I have written many, many books, but they all have only one message: the heart's power of love must replace the mind's love of power. If I have the power of love, then I shall claim the whole world as my own. So at every moment we have to know whether we are using the heart-power to enlarge ourselves or the mind-power to blind and bind ourselves.



* Professor Reynolds: I am glad that you are continuing your mission.

/Sri Chinmoy:/ Every year we go out to different countries and try to be of service to mankind. We feel that life is a tree. We want to climb up as many branches as possible, because each branch has its own beauty, its own purity, its own unique qualities and special message. We feel that each individual on earth is a special dream of God, and that it is the bounden duty of each and every individual to transform the particular dream that he embodies into a reality. How do we do it? Only by claiming the entire world as our own, very own. The world does not need another Julius Caesar or Napoleon to declare his superiority. This world needs someone who will say, "I came, I loved and I have become."



* Professor Reynolds: That is a very good point -- the old style of conquering has to be transformed.

/Sri Chinmoy:/ Right! What we have to conquer is our ignorance. By conquering others only the ego gets joy. The world does not need another Hiroshima or Nagasaki; it has got that experience. Now if you go to these places you see monuments to peace. Wisdom has dawned. Once upon a time we thought that destruction would bring joy. Now we see that joy comes only from peace, which is founded on the feeling of oneness and the realisation that we belong to one world-family. If you care for peace, you have to care for oneness. Oneness cannot be taken away from peace. They are like the obverse and reverse of the same coin.
