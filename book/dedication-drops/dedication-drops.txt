True detachment means
Not to try to influence the world,
Convince the world
Or guide the world
In one's own way,
But to allow the world to grow
In God's way,
For in each individual
There is a spark of divinity.
Let divinity act
In and through each individual --
Seeker or non-seeker --
For the Inner Pilot knows best
How to operate
In and through each human being.

In a human family
We quarrel and struggle
Because we feel that each one
Has to survive
For his own earth-satisfaction.

Because we feel that each individual
Is responsible for the collective satisfaction
And collective perfection.

In a divine family
God plays the preparation-role,
The perfection-role,
The satisfaction-role.

The divine family
Is the only thing
That God desperately needs
Here on earth.

To the real in me,
To the Supreme in me,
To the Inner Pilot in me,
To the divine Lover
And
To the divine Beloved in me.
Now my surrender is not imposed.
Now my surrender is my expansion.
Now my surrender is the song
Of self-illumination,
Self-perfection
And
God-satisfaction
In me.

"Child, I shall give you
What I am.
Even if you do not care for

And
Satisfies the human in us
And
Fulfils the divine in us
Is the only Truth.

The song of sacrifice I sing.

When I sing the song of oneness-reality,
There is no sacrifice,
For in the realisation of oneness-light,
There can be no sacrifice,
Only the song of transformation,
Constant transformation.

The lower and the higher
Fulfil each other.
The lower in me fulfils the higher
By serving the higher.
The higher in me fulfils the lower
By transforming the lower.
In the real fulfilment of one's total existence
There is no sacrifice;
It is only the game of
Oneness-song
And
Oneness-dance.
