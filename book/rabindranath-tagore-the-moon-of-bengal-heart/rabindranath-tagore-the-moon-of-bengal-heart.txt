O Sun of India’s sky,
O World-Poet,
O Moon of Bengal’s heart,
You were beautiful in your inner life,
You were beautiful in your outer life,
You were beauty incarnate in God’s entire Creation.
Gloriously and triumphantly you secure your place
In the world-assembly with your creative force,
Supremely meaningful and fruitful in various walks of life.[fn:: RTMB 1. This song was composed by Sri Chinmoy on May 7th, 1979 and performed by him the same day at the United Nations in New York during a programme celebrating the anniversary of the Poet’s birth. The programme was called “A Tribute to Tagore” and was sponsored by Sri Chinmoy: The Peace Meditation at the United Nations. The song appears in Sri Chinmoy, Blue Waves of the Ocean Source, New York: Agni Press, 1979, p.37. The translation is by Sri Chinmoy.]

  :END:


The life of almost every great poet is blessed with some special gifts. Rabindranath was an adorer of Nature. In the West, Wordsworth and Shelley also studied in the same school of Nature. These three mighty poets wanted to establish a relation with Nature beautifully, sincerely, and finally inseparably. But the aspect of Nature that Tagore loved most was her beauty.



* Art

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: RTMB:6
  :END:


The sole function of Art is to discover beauty within and without. And Art is in itself a self-expression of the different levels of Consciousness.

The mysterious slogan “Art for Art’s sake” expressed by Victor Cousin is, however, only partially true. To quote Sri Aurobindo:


#+BEGIN_QUOTE

“Art for Art’s sake certainly -- Art as a perfect form of and discovery of Beauty; but also Art for the soul’s sake, the spirit’s sake and the expression of all that the soul, the spirit wants to seize through the medium of beauty.”

#+END_QUOTE

In the words of Tagore,

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

“Art, like life itself, has grown by its own impulse, and man has taken his pleasure in it without definitely knowing what it is.”

/Personality/

#+END_QUOTE


There is a considerable difference between the Art of the East and that of the West. Tagore has lucidly defined the object of Oriental Art and Occidental Art:

The greatness and beauty of Oriental art, especially in Japan and China, consists in this, that there the artists have seen the soul of things and they believe in it. The West may believe in the soul of Man, but she does not really believe that the universe has a soul. Yet this belief of the East and the whole mental contribution of the East to mankind is filled with this idea. So, we, in the East, need not go into details and emphasise them; for the most important thing is this universal soul, for which the Eastern sages have sat in meditation, and the Eastern artists have joined them in artistic realisation.

Art has a character of its own as society or spirituality has. It is an absurdity on the face of it to think that Art is and must for ever remain a faithful servant to morality. Art is freedom itself. Art is that which finds equal delight in the core of beauty and in the core of ugliness. Verily the nature of Art is an all-seeking harmony.

In spite of the general belief that beauty and truth are two separate things, Keats has told us that “Beauty is truth, truth beauty.”

Beauty and Tagore were inseparable friends -- one soul in two bodies.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

“The world being nothing but Spirit made visible, is, according to Tagore, fundamentally a thing of beauty. The scars and spots that are on the surface have to be removed and mankind has to repossess and clothe itself with that mantle of beauty. The world is beautiful, because it is the image of the Beautiful, because it harbours, expresses and embodies the Divine, who is Beauty supreme.”

Beauty is always sweet. But why is it so? Here is the answer given by Tagore:

Mother Bengal’s literary contribution to Tagore’s childhood was a very meagre presentation. The poet in his teens increased and enlarged it into a swift-flowing river.

Rabindranath’s love and sacrifice for Bengal were one and the same. In 1905, at the time of the partition of Bengal, the patriot in Rabindranath suffered more than the poet. His immortal prayer ran:


#+BEGIN_QUOTE

“Let all brothers and sisters of Bengal be one, be one, be one, O God.”

As every canon admits of exception, even so this truth does not always hold. But in the life of Rabindranath it is absolutely true.

The more we make a child happy, the more we can expect good of him. It is but a child’s cheerful face that can frighten away the teeming ills of the world.

To serve a unique purpose Tagore invites a child to appear on the world-scene.


#+BEGIN_QUOTE

“They [men] are cruel in their greed and their envy, their words are like hidden knives thirsting for blood.

Go and stand amidst their scowling hearts, my child, and let your gentle eyes fall upon them like the forgiving peace of the evening over the strife of the day.

Let them see your face, my child, and thus know the meaning of all things; let them love you and thus love each other.

Come and take your seat in the bosom of the limitless, my child.”

The child of Mary came to preach Love and Surrender to God and establish on earth the Kingdom of Heaven. He brought our soul to the fore and declared: “I and my Father are one.”

The tenet of Christ -- love thy neighbour as thyself -- has been interpreted by Tagore with a new orientation. He opines that it is not an ordinary precept; here the emphasis is not on loving one’s own neighbour but on loving as one’s own self.

Creation within, creation without. To look at the surface of Tagore’s creative genius without trying to fathom its depth is simply to judge him in parts.

Education is that which tends towards the formation of character. To quote Tagore,

“I believe that the object of education is the freedom of mind which can only be achieved through the path of freedom -- though freedom has its risk and responsibility as life itself has.”

#+END_QUOTE

He throws more light on education when he observes:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

“The highest education is that which does not merely give us information but makes our life in harmony with all existence.”

#+END_QUOTE

A school, however perfect, is nothing more than a road leading to education. Who is ignorant of the fact that Tagore himself was not a school product? Yet at the same time, Rabindranath’s knowledge was as vast as the Indian Ocean.

One’s puny ego is the worst possible foe of love. Therefore, the poet in Tagore in lamentation cries out:

“I came out alone on my way to my tryst. But who is this that follows me in the silent dark? . . .

He is my own little self, my Lord, he knows no shame; but I am ashamed to come to thy door in his company.”

#+END_QUOTE

True, Tagore was a fond child of Fortune; but how wonderfully he developed and utilised his gifts in the creation of love and beauty is of supreme importance. He was, we can say, a golden chance. But Tagore made himself infinitely more valuable than this chance. By dint of his unique genius he has become the loveliest choice of present-day humanity.

Dignity is the brave son of freedom and the true father of joy.

Tagore asks women not to try to tie down their husbands, but to allow them full freedom. The imposition of bondage is sure to recoil on them, and, at the same time, it is apt to deprive the male of his manliness.

In his /Fruit Gathering/, Tagore sings as regards his own freedom:

“It is a mere tautology to say that God is unknowable, when we leave altogether out of account the person who can and does know Him.

Humour has a free access not only to our emotions but also to our intellect. To produce genuine humour is not an easy thing. It demands genius. Out of Tagore’s numerous touches of humour, let me cite here only three to show that even his genius as a humourist India cannot deny.



1.

If I look with my eyes open, my wife suspects that I am on the lookout for her sister. If I sit with my eyes closed, she thinks that my mind is occupied with her sister. If I cough, she ascribes some motive to it. And if I check it with my utmost efforts, she sees into it something more serious.

3.


#+BEGIN_QUOTE

The thermometer of love shows three degrees of temperature. When a man asserts that he has not fallen in love, it indicates the subnormal temperature of 95°. When he admits that he loves, then he runs the temperature of 98.4°, which is, according to the doctors, quite normal and entirely free from any danger. But when the fever of love exceeds 105°, the patient ceases to use all endearing terms and begins to call his beloved names; in the absence of such behaviour; his heart would burst by the pressure of the steam of love, and it may lead to an accident of the worst type. It is only an M.D. in the medical science of love who can estimate how delirious becomes the language of a patient stricken with the fever of love.

#+END_QUOTE


Now let us place Tagore’s own view as regards humour:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

“Humour is a dangerous thing. It is well if it surrenders itself willingly with a smiling face, but a catastrophe may result if you try to take it by storm.”

/From his letters/

#+END_QUOTE

We find in the famous book /Mangputé Rabindranath/, by Maitreyi Devi, a fine specimen of Tagore’s sense of humour.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

“Don’t you know, it is already proved that I am not entitled to cut jokes? A professor has given his verdict that a lyric poet cannot have any sense of humour. Irrefutable is his reasoning. Therefore it has to be admitted that either I possess no sense of humour or I am not a poet at all. Is it not a pity that I am about to lose my celebrity as a poet which I have acquired with so much toil?”

“The cause of Japan’s strength lies in the fact that she does not fritter away her energy in fruitless hustle-bustle and exchanges of hot words. As there is no waste of energy, the Japanese do not run short of it at the hour of their need. The mental and vital peace and endurance form a characteristic feature in their national character. They know how to control themselves when they are confronted with grief, sorrow, shock and causes for indignation. That is why the foreigners fail to understand the Japanese mind.”

Tagore’s plays have a vast and sublime range of poignant emotion, and in some of them how wonderfully he reveals the teeming storms of life with a new orientation.

/Prakritir Pratishodh/ (Nature’s Revenge): in this play we find an ascetic of the first water coming back to ordinary human life through his commiseration with poor humanity. The play teaches us that Nature is bound to take revenge on us if we despise her.

/Chitrangada/ (Chitra) was the daughter of the king of Manipur. Her physical beauty compelled Arjuna, the third Pandava, to accept her as the partner of his life. But as satisfaction was not to be found in physical beauty, he sought for the Beauty that lies beyond the body.

/Raja/ (The King of the Dark Chamber) is, according to some critics, nothing more than an allegory. But Tagore writes:


#+BEGIN_QUOTE

“Critics and detectives are naturally suspicious. They scent allegories and bombs where there are no such abominations. It is difficult to convince them of our innocence. With regard to the criticism of my play /The King of the Dark Chamber/ . . . the human soul has its inner drama, which is just the same as anything else that concerns man. Sudarshana is not more allegory than Lady Macbeth, who might be described as an allegory representing the criminal ambition in man’s nature. However, it does not matter what things are according to the rules of the critics. They are what they are and therefore difficult of classification.”

#+END_QUOTE

The moment Sudarshana realised that in enjoying the outer beauty alone the true fulfilment of life can never be attained, she utterly surrendered herself to the king and in no time she discovered the secret that in the offering of oneself there lies the key of true fulfilment.

An interesting event. One day while Tagore was residing at Maitreyi Devi’s place at Mangpu, which is near Kalimpong, a French lady, Mademoiselle Boshenec, came before the Poet and said, “Gurudeva, to-day /Post Office/ will be staged in France.” After observing silence for a few minutes, Tagore said that in Russia /The King of the Dark Chamber/ was staged repeatedly. Again after a long silence: “This is called reward,” said he.

/Dakghar/ (The Post Office) is another play that brought him much fame. A young life full of expectation was Amal’s. All that he wanted was to go ‘somewhere’ and see ‘something’. Poor Amal’s expectation of a letter from the king clearly indicates that human life is nothing but an expectation right from the womb to the tomb.

“The poetry of Tagore owes its sudden and universal success to this advantage -- that he gives us more of this discovery and fusion for which the mind of our age is in quest than any other creative writer of the time.

There are critics who say that Tagore cannot be classed with the poets of the highest magnitude, for he did not try an epic. O wiseacre! his lyrics have sufficient power to lift you up into the realm of poetic delight where his pen reigns supreme over almost all branches of Art.

To many of us it is but an insoluble mystery whether Tagore moulded his life according to the growth of his poetical works or whether it was his gradual poetical flow that brought about successive vicissitudes in his outer life. However, his poetical genius and his life marched side by side in a perfect harmony.

It was his wonderful /Nirjharer Swapnabhanga/, (The Awakening of the Fountain) that took him for the first time into the realm of Intuition. A new life dawned within him, and he looked at the creation with a new vision.

/Sonar Tari/ (The Golden Boat): this unique poem was mercilessly criticised by many uncomprehending critics. Some called it sheer mysticism, others claimed that the poem was nothing but barren mist. To me at least, it is nothing inferior to a lucid touch of Revelation, however small in quantity it might be. Here the finite wants to taste the Infinite; further, the finite wants to be one with the all-pervading Infinite.

#+END_VERSE

The birth of the philosopher we notice in Rabindranath the day he brought to light one of his earliest works, /Sandhya Sangit/ (Evening Songs). And this philosopher expressed himself through Tagore’s innumerable writings, until the latter breathed his last.

In /Naivedya/ (Offering) we find the poet Rabindranath declaring that he does not belong to the school of Renunciation. The world is not illusionary. Its joy and sorrow, its beauty and ugliness have a veritable value. He wanted to view and acquire Truth and Beauty in and from all the objects of the world. He sings:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

“Mine is not the seat of Yoga
Behind the doors of senses shut.”

#+END_QUOTE

In height and depth, in grandeur and sublimity, no other poem of Tagore’s can equal /Balaka/. Here the doors of the world beyond are, as it were, thrown wide open to him. Not only did he bring down the truths of that world, but also he bestowed these achievements on all Bengali literature. Ceaselessly and dauntlessly the world shall march towards its final goal. The surge of beauty that pervades the earth is never a chimera’s mist. This beauty is a self-fulfilling truth.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

“I hear the wild restless flutterings of wings
In the depth of silence, in the air, on land and sea.
Herbs and shrubs flap their wings over the earthy sky.
Who can say, what is there in the tenebrous womb of the earth?
Millions of seeds open out their wings
Even like flights of cranes.
I see ranges of those hillocks, those forests
Moving with outspread wings from isle to isle,
From the unknown to the unknown.”
With the flutter of starry wings
Darkness glimmers in the weeping night.

#+END_VERSE

To be sure, /Urvasie/ (The Celestial Nymph) is the wonder of wonders produced in the field of Tagore’s poetry. It is here that he reaches the acme of beauty filled with delight. Verily, according to Tagore, Urvasie is at once an eternally self-revealing and self-fulfilling goddess.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

“O Urvasie swaying soft and sweet,
When thou dancest before the assembly of the gods,
Thrills of delight course through thy limbs,
Waves upon waves swirl rhythmically in the bosom of the ocean,
The undulating tips of the shivering corn
Appear like the fluttering skirt of mother earth.
From the necklace hung upon thy breast
Drop down the stars on the floor of the sky.
And all at once man loses his masculine heart in sheer rapture.”

#+END_VERSE

Silence, silence, in a pin-drop silence /Puravi/ sings so sweetly in the core of the poet’s heart his songs of Farewell. No more does the poet care for the hustle-bustle of broad daylight. Self-sufficient in peace, he no longer permits the reminiscences of the past, however sweet, to jog his mind.

From his exquisite poem, /Swarga Hate Viday/ (To Bid Adieu to Heaven), we can easily grasp the idea that earthly love and beauty are more intense and delightful than those of Heaven precisely because they are transient. For love and beauty exist in Heaven for good.

It is said that the poet’s poem and the prophet’s word fly higher than a high-pinioned bird. No wonder, then, that Tagore became at once a poet and a prophet of the highest magnitude when his pen produced /Namaskar/ (Salutation).

Tagore was essentially a Master-poet by temperament, immediately and exquisitely conscious of every claim of mellifluous beauty in all its multifarious forms. His was a personality of singular charm, and a character of singular sweetness. The more we sing Tagore’s songs, the better the transparent sincerity breathing through them impresses us.

Needless to say, in the field of prose, too, he is undoubtedly a treasure-house of penetrating wisdom, sublime and beautiful thoughts. His sparkling prose-works are both great and delightfully helpful to the present-day need of humanity. Many of his prose books guide us rightly and purposely through the thick and thin of life. And it is, as it were, an imperative need for an adorer of Bengali literature to quote Tagore’s prose to justify the author’s own genius.

Let me reproduce here a pleasantly readable remark made by Tagore on prose.

“I wonder why the writing of pages of prose does not give one anything like the joy of completing a single poem.

Truth had a peculiar dream. In the dream he saw Tagore’s prose and Tagore’s poetry exchanging hot words.

Prose: “Poetry, you must admit that I gave Rabindranath perfection long before you. And when? When he was but in his teens.”

Poetry: “True, you gave him perfection before me. But the real sense of it came only after I had been recognised. It is the Nobel Prize given to me that illumined your own depths to the world.”

Rabindranath: A towering personality of multifarious achievements.

In Rabindranath’s works Bengali literature rightly deserves to shake hands with world literature.

A day shall dawn when Rabindranath’s soul-stirring songs will go a long way to the formation of character of the Indians.

His was a Spirit that was ever open to the new Light.

His was the politics that could never be separated from the core of spirituality.

Rabindranath’s Viswabharati is a glorious idea seeking a perfect Form.

A marvel indeed, Rabindranath had the rare capacity to mingle the strains of human sorrow and joy, human sweetness and bitterness into one song.

Dancing was looked down upon in Bengal until Rabindranath’s tireless toil and mighty personality rehabilitated this art. Dancing was then taken up even by the girls and women of aristocratic families. Rabindranath’s faultless view is that dancing is undoubtedly a means of self-expression.

Tagore’s name received unimaginable fame through the length and breadth of the world, while his heart received tremendous blows one after another. How difficult it was for him to put his sufferings aside! His wife expired when she was on the right side of forty, and some of his children died quite young. Moreover; death snatched away some of his devoted young admirers who, he had thought, would add much to the glory of Bengal. Curiously enough, all these bereavements occurred in the course j of three successive years. So Tagore once remarked that to live a long life is not at all a blessing.

A memorable event: we all know that Tagore breathed his last on August 7, 1941. In that very year, on May 6, 1941, his 80th birthday had been celebrated all over the world. On this occasion Mahatma Gandhi’s greeting ran:

“I wish to let you know how I have been impressed by the amazing intensity of your energy in spreading education among the masses.

You have recognised the truth that in extirpating all social evils one has to go to the root, which can only be through education.”

“Socrates is said to have brought down philosophy from heaven to live among men upon earth. A similar exploit may be ascribed to Tagore. The Spirit, the bare transcendental Reality contemplated by the orthodox Vedantins, has been brought nearer to our planet, close to human consciousness, in Tagore’s vision, being clothed in earth and flesh and blood, made vivid with the colours and contours of the physical existence. The Spirit, yes by all means, but not necessarily ascetism and monasticism. So Tagore boldly declared in those famous lines of his: ‘Mine is not the deliverance achieved through mere renunciation. Mine, rather, the freedom that tastes itself in a thousand associations.’”

Rabindranath was the world-song sung by the Singer in him. A golden chain of beauty and love did come into existence from this world-song to bind the two extremities of the globe, the East and the West.

But Rabindranath once said that, when he was capable of singing, his own compositions were very few, but when he became a prolific composer of songs his voice failed him.

And here is a prophetic utterance of Tagore about his own songs:


#+BEGIN_QUOTE

“With the march of time everything changes. But I can definitely say that my songs will have a considerably greater stability. Especially the Bengalis will have no other alternative but to sing my songs in the hours of their sorrow, grief, joy and delight. They needs must sing these songs epoch after epoch."

Sorrow helps us immensely. It is apt to humble our pride. It chastens us. It opens our hearts to magnanimity and sympathy. To check our innumerable errors and make us watch ourselves and put us on the road to perfection, sorrow must necessarily exist in the world.

Now Xanthippe. What a contrast! Poor Socrates, the unparalleled philosopher of the time, suffered grievously at his wife’s hands. In other words, should we not rather say in the words of Xenophon, an intimate friend of Socrates as well as a military Commander that Socrates’ wife had a ‘shrewish temper, which Socrates bore patiently’?

Tagore’s birth-centenary was indeed an occasion of rejoicing for us, his admirers, and for enthusiasts of Culture all over the world. It was for the youth of the globe to hail this hallowed opportunity by offering to the Master-poet their profound homage.

Keats’ /Endymion/ is, no doubt, a grand success with its wonderful vividness and splendid felicity. But his /Hyperion/ was, according to many critics, a sad failure. However, one cannot say that /Hyperion/ has no magnificence at all. As ill luck would have it, when this epic was brought to light, the poet was savagely criticised even by his bosom friends. As a result, his health broke down and the long-threatening consumption grew more formidable. He was ultimately compelled to pay his debt to nature. So it will be no exaggeration to say that lack of indomitable zeal was in the main responsible for snatching away one of the wonder-poets of the world. Poor earth could not cherish his presence even for thirty fleeting years.

Now let us focus our attention on Rabindranath’s zeal. During his earlier days he had to face very bitter criticism of his writings in season and out of season. Kaliprasanna Kabyabisharad, the well-known editor of the Bengali weekly /Hitavadi/, probably stood as the bitterest and most impossible critic of Tagore’s works. His merciless pen runs:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

“Flap not your wings to fly, O pigeon-poet! Stay where you are, in your hole. Even to your babblings and to your bullyings you have given the air of poesy. That too you have published as a work of Art. And the return it has fetched you was one full rupee in cash.”

#+END_QUOTE

Any other poet of lesser zeal would have sunk down under the weight of such ruthless criticism, but Rabindranath proved to have an adamant nature. And that is why he was so successful. In spite of innumerable blows from his boyhood to the end of his life, his eyes smiled and his lips sang like the beautiful flowers and lucid sunbeams peering through the saffron robes of Dawn.

Vivekananda was a flaming tongue of fire. Tagore was a sea of beauty and delight. Vivekananda was a clarion-call. Tagore was a soul-stirring flute. To both, humanity was a great love, dynamic and powerful on the part of Vivekananda, soft and sweet on the part of Tagore.

Vivekananda says in effect: “No time to linger! Awake, O India, and with your dauntless strength achieve the loftiest height of your Spirit.” Tagore says in effect: “Look everywhere and see God’s beauty, and then, O Ind, raise your proud head towards the Highest.”

With his spirit’s height, Vivekananda was the most nourishing, life- giving fruit. With his creative genius, Rabindranath was the most beautiful flower. The Goddess Mahakali shone in the eyes of Vivekananda. The Goddess Mahalakshmi smiled through the eyes of Rabindranath.

Yet it was only after the recognition of the West that the East would claim them, the spiritual giant by the impact of his Chicago address, the mystic poet by virtue of his /Gitanjali/. In both cases, the divine singer expressed himself in divine measure. Through his spiritual emotion and his soul-stirring voice, Narendra pleased his divine Master, Sri Ramakrishna, and through him, the world. By his soul-awakening songs of transcendental beauty, Rabindranath charmed the world and seized the All- Blissful.

Both Narendranath and Rabindranath came into the world from the Unknown. They were, as it were, two tireless voyagers. Rabindranath touched the earth-sphere in 1861, just two fleeting years before Narendranath. Narendranath left earth and entered the upper-sphere in 1902, thirty-nine long years before Rabindranath.

The Poet came up the stairs and, throwing off his cap and shoes, rushed in, hands outstretched, at the sight of Sri Aurobindo standing at the other end of the room. Sri Aurobindo caught his hands and requested him to sit in a chair./

/At this first look and touch, the Poet appeared overwhelmed and drawn back within himself./

TAGORE: It is eighteen years since you left Bengal. All this time I have longed, off and on, to see you. My longing is fulfilled today. But I know it couldn’t have been if you hadn’t made a special concession for me. I lence I am all the more grateful to you. As I have already written to you, I am now on my way to Europe. I ask: if they want to know of you, what shall I tell them?

SRI AUROBINDO: I too am glad to meet you. As for Europe, if they want to know of me, they are free to come here. My Ashram is open to sincere seekers from anywhere.

TAGORE: I wonder how you can run your Ashram and do your worldwide work from within your room in a corner of the earth. My wonder increases a hundred-fold when I think of my tremendous struggle and labour, in India and abroad, for the Viswabharati. Now I am out seeking help overseas.

SRI AUROBINDO: I am not troubled about the future. It’s the Divine’s work which the Divine does.

/(Exit Rabindranath, quite a different man. He had come all the way upstairs, talking with Nolini Kanta, complimenting him on his literary abilities, appreciating his originality and terseness of expression of thought and wishing him to turn to short stories: in a word, he was vivacious and “social". After the interview with Sri Aurobindo he came down concentrated and silent. Returning to the steamer he shut himself up in a cabin and spent a long time alone. The Poet’s classic reaction to the interview came out in the /“Modern Review”/ of Calcutta some time after.)/[fn:: RTMB 99,8.

Gandhi often fasted to get things done in his own way . . . [On one occasion] Gandhi took a vow that he would fast unto death. Tagore immediately said to his countrymen, having realised the gravity of Gandhi’s vow: “He has come after a thousand years. Shall we send him back empty-handed again?”

Gandhi’s Gurudev, Rabindranath Tagore, once remarked:

When Subhas was only in his teens, he wrote to his brother, Sarat, about the treatment of Rabindranath Tagore by his own Bengali countrymen. The young heart cried:

Around 1914, while Subhas Chandra was studying at the Presidency College, he took his friends to Santiniketan for their first meeting with Tagore. Subhas sought advice from the Poet with regard to the life-activities of the students. Unfortunately, Tagore could not satisfy Subhas.

{{{flueron}}}

Their most auspicious second meeting was without doubt a Heaven-blessed coincidence. It took place when Subhas was returning to India in 1921 after his years at university in England, and Rabindranath happened to be a fellow passenger on the boat. Tagore and Subhas engaged in many heart-to-heart conversations. The Poet, who was Subhas Chandra’s senior by thirty-six years, did offer the young man his sincere congratulations for having resigned so bravely from the I.C.S.

Subhas, on his side, found in Rabindranath a kindred spirit -- for had not the Poet renounced his knighthood following the massacre of his countrymen by the British at Jallianwalla Bagh?

Through the Free India Centre, which Netaji established in Germany, Rabindranath Tagore’s song /Jana Gana Mana/ was played and sung for the first time in Hamburg on 29 May 1942.

Simultaneously, India’s tri-colour banner was hoisted, along with the German flag. The German national anthem was then played.

The Mayor of Hamburg gave Netaji the warmest welcome.

Eventually, Tagore’s /Jana Gana/ was adopted as the official national anthem of independent India. Once again, Gandhi-ji and Nehru followed Netaji’s lead.

The mutual affection between these two Bengali giants was most touchingly revealed whenever either of them succumbed to physical ailments. On 19 October 1930, in New Haven, Connecticut, U.S.A., Tagore fell seriously ill. Subhas came to learn the news from Reuters, and he immediately sent a wire to the Poet:

CITY OF CALCUTTA ANXIOUS ABOUT YOUR ILLNESS STOP ON BEHALF OF THE CITIZENS I WISH SPEEDY RECOVERY AND A SAFE RETURN HOME STOP WIRE HEALTH STOP SUBHAS

Tagore was extremely moved by Subhas Chandra’s love and concern, and he wired back:

THANK YOU SUBHAS I FEEL MUCH BETTER STOP YOUR RABINDRANATH

On his part also, Tagore used to write most affectionate letters enquiring about Subhas Chandra’s health whenever word reached him that Subhas was suffering on the physical plane.

{{{flueron}}}

In 1940 Tagore requested an interview with Subhas. In spite of his deepest love, deepest admiration and deepest respect for Tagore, it took Subhas two long months to offer him an interview, for Subhas had been inundated with myriad activities since resigning the Presidency in April 1939.

Finally, on 2 July, Tagore came and met with him in Calcutta for about two hours. Afterwards, Tagore left for Santiniketan, only to hear on his return that Subhas had been arrested -- just three fleeting hours after the interview had taken place. It was to be his eleventh and last imprisonment.

Soul-heart-mind-vital-body
Had become a perfect sacrifice for Mother India,

The British Government home-interned Subhas in December 1940. The real royal Bengal Tiger, to the nation’s widest astonishment, disappeared the following month! This disappearance of his created a tremendous sensation and uproar nationwide.

Poet Rabindranath Tagore was anxiety-stricken. He immediately sent a message by telegram to the family of Subhas:

DEEPLY CONCERNED OVER SUBHAS DISAPPEARANCE STOP CONVEY TO MOTHER MY SYMPATHY STOP KINDLY KEEP ME INFORMED NEWS

Sarat Chandra Bose wired back:

Two immortals: Tagore and Einstein. During their memorable interview at Einstein’s place in Berlin, both of them unfortunately had to enjoy a difference of opinions. True, indeed, is the saying, “Many minds, many ways.”

“This world,” said Tagore, “is a human world. The scientific view of it is only that of the scientific man. Therefore, the world apart from us humans does not exist; it is a relative world, depending for its reality upon our consciousness. There is a standard of reason which gives it truth -- the standard of the eternal man, whose experiences are made possible through our experiences.”

At the end of the journey’s close, each individual is entitled to reach his destination according to his inner experiences and outer manifestations. The approaches of these two unique individuals to the reality-world were strikingly different, but needless to say both of them, from two different angles, will eventually arrive at the self-same goal: oneness-satisfaction and satisfaction-perfection.[fn:: RTMB 102.

Almost every day he listened to Bengal’s best vocalists singing selections from Tagore’s opus, and he himself at times performed Tagore’s songs in concerts around the world. In his conversations and talks, Sri Chinmoy made many references to Tagore’s unparalleled contribution to Bengali literature, as well as his profound impact on the West that culminated in his being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913. Sri Chinmoy was also charmed by Tagore’s unique personality and was particularly appreciative of Tagore’s magnanimous heart, which often manifested in lofty praise of his contemporaries. This chapter contains some of Sri Chinmoy’s comments and reflections gathered from his talks and writings over the years.]

I happen to be a great admirer of Tagore’s music. Almost every morning or during the day, I listen to Tagore’s songs. Tagore’s poems are totally different from others’ writings. Each poem of his is from the heart. There is not a single poem by Tagore that came from the mind. An Irish poet -- W.B. Yeats -- saw something in Tagore which was unique, and that is why he brought Tagore to the fore. When he sent Tagore’s poems to the Nobel Prize Committee, he pointed out that this was something totally new, a new approach.[fn::RTMB 103,1. June 14th, 2002. Previously unpublished.]

Before Tagore got the Nobel Prize in 1913, one particular poem of his, a very nice poem, was criticised so ruthlessly, ruthlessly, in a magazine. Each and every line of the poem was mercilessly criticised. Three weeks later, Tagore got the Nobel Prize for Literature. Then immediately the same writer absolutely extolled Tagore to the skies for that particular poem. It was the same magazine, the same writer, the same poem! Look at how people can change their coat! This incident is famous. Only three weeks prior to his Nobel Prize, Tagore received such wild criticism. Then, in three weeks, the story changed. The writer found such significant things in the poem. Life is like that.[fn:: RTMB 105,1. May 5th, 2002. Previously unpublished.]

Some of the elder writers of those days made fun of Tagore and criticised him before he got the Nobel Prize. As a poet, he was not recognised at all in Bengal, not to speak of India. His unbearable critics used to say, “Oh, he comes of a very high family, a distinguished family. That is why he is getting credit for his poems.” Tagore’s father was so great and his elder brothers were all very great in various fields. The Tagore family was India’s greatest family. That is why those critics used to say that Tagore was not a good writer.

Then, after Tagore received the Nobel Prize, his worst critics came to Santiniketan to honour him. They came by train, a deputation of about thirty or forty of them, those who had not been in favour of his writings. Tagore was a little bit annoyed. He said, “Just a few days ago, you were my worst critics. Now you have come to honour me. I do not need your honour.” Those ‘well-wishers’ were therefore unable to hold a function to honour Tagore, and they left. Tagore was upset and they were also upset that they had come all the way and Tagore had not received them well. A few weeks later, Tagore personally went to them and asked for forgiveness. Then they forgave him.[fn:: RTMB 105,3. October 10th, 2002 and January 7th, 2007. Previously unpublished.]

Tagore is the only poet to have two national songs to his credit. /Jana Gana Mana/ is the national anthem of India and /Amar Sonar Bangla/ is the national anthem of Bangladesh. That one song, /Amar Sonar Bangla/, has touched the highest heights of Immortality. The words are absolutely simpler than the simplest, but they carry such inner depth:

/Amar sonar Bangla, ami tomai bhalobasi./ \\
O my golden Bengal, I love you.

This is how the song starts. Inside these words there is such feeling. Tagore is giving a description of Bengal’s beauty.

I am a poet, a self-styled poet. If I am to be the judge, I will give /Amar Sonar Bangla/ the highest award. It is so simple, so sweet, so soulful and so blissful -- what more can I say? It is sweeter than the sweetest and most beautiful. Such a sweet, melodious song! The whole song is a description of Mother Bengal. Sweetness, softness, mellowness and so many other good qualities this song embodies.

When I came to the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, my brother Chitta taught me Bengali metre. It took him about a week or so. There are four or five main Bengali metres. English also has many metres, such as iambus, trochee and spondee. But Bengali has more metres. Chitta taught me, and my ear was fortunately very trained. He used Tagore’s poems as examples and then he said, “This is how it was done.” There are many, many poems of Tagore’s that are very, very easy to scan. And then there are some metres that Tagore used which are very, very complicated. Those also I learned.

There are two metres that are very common. One deals with the letters of the alphabet, and the other with sound. In India, I wrote both sound and letter metres, but here in America it seems to me I have written the sound metre more than the letter metre. That is how Chitta taught me. When I started writing my song /‘Uthe Jakhan Pub Gagane Savita’/, my brother was in the seventh heaven of delight because the metre was correct. Again, I wrote some poems with both metres together -- sound metre and letter metre. They were very difficult, very difficult.[fn:: RTMB 112,2. August 16th, 2002. Previously unpublished.]

Tagore’s song /‘Jana Gana Mana’/ is composed in a Sanskrit metre. This meter is called laghu guru -- laghu means ‘short’, guru means ‘long’.

When Tagore was preparing the English translation of Gitanjali, he made it the first song. -- Ed.] They told Tagore, “This is a mistake.” But on that occasion, Tagore said, “Who cares for metre?”

He has written a particular word because he loves the word so much. Tagore is the supreme authority, so who is going to challenge him? If anybody says that Tagore does not know metre, it is absurd. He is making an exception because he likes the word so much. He could have used another word, true. But for him, his joy was infinitely more important than the metre. Those who know metre will always agree that this word is not correct, but he was above it. That poem has such feeling, such sentiment, such an intimate connection with God, with Divinity.[fn:: RTMB 113,3. December 12th, 1997. Previously unpublished.]

Recently, a very well known singer named Lakshmi Shankar, who is the sister-in-law of the great sitar player Ravi Shankar, said something so inspiring to me. She said that of all the instruments, Tagore liked the esraj the most. She said Tagore’s favourite instrument was the esraj, and he encouraged people to learn to play it. I was very happy to hear that piece of news from Lakshmi Shankar.

Many, many years ago, one of Tagore’s students, named Shantidev Ghosh, came to the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, and he played the esraj. He had set to music a very long poem of Tagore’s. I cannot imagine how he was able to play on the esraj and sing at the same time. He did it, but the pitch of his singing voice was quite high. I never dare to sing any song of mine while playing the esraj. But Shantidev was a very, very eminent singer in Bengal and it was an unforgettable experience.[fn:: RTMB 119,2. May 20th, 2005.

In 1961, for Tagore’s birth centenary, I wrote a book on him. At that time, a very great Bengali literary figure happened to come to the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. According to Sri Aurobindo, he was one step behind nirvana. This gentleman’s name was Sri Anirvan. ‘Anirvan’ means one who has not yet reached the nirvana stage. He was a very great figure, a sage-savant. He stayed for a few days at my friend’s place. One day I went to see him and I read out my whole book on Tagore to him. Afterwards, Sri Anirvan wrote, “His comments on Rabindranath are penetrating.” Then he said, “I do not like your title,” and he changed the title of the book. He gave the title /Rabindranath: The Myriad-Minded./

I offer my soulful gratitude to the soul of Sri Anirvan for having written the introduction to my book. It was also most kind of Sri Anirvan to give the title /Rabindranath: The Myriad-Minded/.[fn:: RTMB 120,2. June 7th, 2002. Previously unpublished. It seems that the word ‘myriad-minded’ was first used to describe Tagore by Oxford University in 1940 when it conferred upon him an Honorary Degree. Sir Maurice Gwyer, who gave the oration, said, in part: “Here before you is the myriad-minded poet and writer, the musician famous in his art, the philosopher proven both in word and deed ...” Ref: Krishna Dutta and Andrew Robinson, Rabindranath Tagore: The Myriad- Minded Man, Tauris & Co, London, 2009, p. 353. - Ed.]

During my visits to India, when I used to sing my song /‘Ore Mor Kheya Ore Mor Neye’/ for my brother Chitta while playing the harmonium, right from the beginning tears and tears would roll down his cheeks. This song means, “O my Boat, O my Boatman, O message of Transcendental Delight, carry me.”

In that song I have used poetic license. Some great poets coin hundreds and hundreds of words which you will not find in the dictionary. You have to study those great poets in order to know the meaning of some particular words. The word /kheya/ we do find in the dictionary. It means ‘a small boat’. But the word /neye/, meaning ‘boatman’, you will not find in the dictionary. The proper Bengali word is /nabik. Nabik/ means ‘pilot’. From /nabik/, how can you come to /neye/? I learnt this word from Tagore. It happened that Tagore once wanted a short word, a very sweet word, so he transformed /nabik/ into /neye/.

Nowadays the dictionary writers are very clever. Formerly, for centuries, there were quite a few words that were not available in the dictionary. Now the dictionary has started accepting those coined words because such-and-such a writer used the word. Before, we learnt things from the dictionary. Now the dictionary is learning from the great authors.[fn:: RTMB 121,3. January 12th, 2004. Previously unpublished.]

And then Najrul Islam wrote a few songs on Tagore which were so beautiful, so soulful and so meaningful.[fn:: RTMB 122. April 17th, 2005. Previously unpublished.]

Tagore himself requested Dilip Kumar Roy to dive into music. Then Dilip’s friend, Subhas Bose, said to him, “Listen to Tagore, listen! Dive into music.”

Once it happened that Dilip did not keep in touch with Tagore for some time. Tagore wrote a poem that ran, “Dilip, I have not seen your smiling face for a long time! You have not written to me.” The whole poem was a letter to Dilip.

Dilip said that Tagore used to inundate him with affection. He argued with Tagore so many times, but Tagore always forgave him and once more they became very close. Then, if Dilip did not write for some time because they had had an altercation, Tagore used to say, “Why, why are you silent?”

Two supreme Bengali singers, Dilip Kumar Roy and Kaji Najrul Islam, happened to be very good friends. They were both great admirers of Tagore, but from time to time they were not on good terms with him. The reason was that they used to sing Tagore’s spiritual songs in restaurants and so-called nightclubs. They used to go there along with some other great singers and composers, and then they would start singing Tagore’s songs.

When Tagore heard, he became furious. “My songs! My songs you will sing in nightclubs!” he said. Then he warned Dilip, Najrul and a few others, “My songs are not meant for nightclubs. You must stop!” Najrul and Dilip were very fond of Tagore, so they stopped singing in nightclubs.[fn:: RTMB 124,2. March 22nd, 2006. Previously unpublished.]

Sahana Devi[fn:: RTMB 125,1. In 2006 Sri Chinmoy prepared a book about Sahana Devi. It has not yet been published. These stories are excerpted from the manuscript, which is entitled Sahana Devi: A Singer of the Supreme Heights.] was a singer of the supreme heights. She had a most glorious singing voice. She was extremely fortunate because she was so closely connected with Tagore. She was a student at Tagore’s Santiniketan, and she sang for him many, many times. Tagore was deeply enamoured of her soul-stirring voice. She also composed many songs.

Dilip Kumar Roy was responsible for bringing Sahana Devi to the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. When Dilip-da joined the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in 1928, he inspired Sahana-di to do the same. Tagore was very upset when Sahana-di left Santiniketan. When she went to the Ashram, he sent an unforgettable message: “Had I been an Emperor, like the Moghul Emperors, I would have sent my army to bring you back from the Ashram.”

During my Ashram days, I basked in the sunshine of Sahana-di’s affection.

Sahana Devi was a supreme authority on Tagore, specially Tagore’s devotional songs. She wrote in one of her articles that Tagore did not care lor tabla or measured Western beat. She said that he wanted only a spontaneous flow.

Then, in a subsequent issue of the same magazine, another authority on Tagore’s music -- Shantidev Ghosh -- said that Tagore really enjoyed tabla and also Western beat. Whom to believe? Both of them studied under Tagore and now there are two different versions. Sahana Devi was older than Shantidev Ghosh by a few years, so perhaps her version is more reliable.

Tagore had ten or twelve students whom he personally invited to study directly under him. They were selected from the several hundred students who attended Santiniketan. Among these selected students, his nephew Dinendranath was the closest. As soon as a tune came to Tagore, he used to sing it for his nephew, and his nephew would give the proper notation. When his nephew died, Tagore said that his right hand had gone. Other students began taking notation for him, but the process became very slow. Tagore always used to say that the reason was that his nephew was more in his consciousness.

Swami Vivekananda in his teens used to go to all the swamis, fakirs and spiritual figures, with only one question: “Have you seen God? Have you seen God?”

They observed his intense sincerity, but the answer was always the same: “Sorry, no, I have not seen God.”

Some of these spiritual figures at that time had disciples as well, but each one was sincere enough to tell the young Naren, “No, I have not seen God.”

Then Swami Vivekananda went to Tagore’s father, Maharshi Debendranath, with the same question. Debendranath said, “I have not seen God, but I can clearly see in your eyes that you will one day realise God. Your eyes tell me that you will see God, you will realise God.” And he showered boundless affection on Naren. Debendranath was the only one who could see Naren’s future.

After conquering the heart of America and the West, Swami Vivekananda came back home. He went to Debendranath to pay his homage and to offer his gratitude because he had received so much affection and so many blessings from Tagore’s father. Tagore’s father was kindness incarnate.

Three or four hours before Tagore left this earth, before he passed behind the curtain of Eternity, he recited the poem /‘Samukhe Sbanti Parabar’/ --  “In front of me is the ocean of peace.” He did not set it to music; somebody else did. The words he uttered are most haunting.

Now there is a serious controversy. Some people are of the opinion that this poem he recited was his final song, but others say that another work was his final song. In that song he was seeing the great soul, the supramental soul. He was envisioning this great soul coming to him.

Santiniketan has chosen /‘Samukhe Sbanti Parabar’/ as the final song and they sing it each year on the anniversary of Tagore’s death. I also feel this is the right one, the last one before he left for his celestial abode. In this poem, he is leaving the earth and seeing the ocean of peace in front of him.[fn:: RTMB 132,3.

Music is the Vedic bird in us. This bird is called /Suparna/. This bird divine flies in the welkin of Infinity, through Eternity, with the message of Immortality.

Here on earth, we do notice that birds have the capacity to sing in endless measure, whereas we human beings try to create or develop this capacity. Tagore defends us:

“To the birds you gave songs, the birds gave you songs in return.
You gave me only a voice, yet asked for more, and I sing.”

#+END_QUOTE

The music-bird is within us to stay, to give us love. The music-bird is without us to fly, to give us joy.

Since music is a universal language, it has no need to express itself in any particular language of the world. Rabindranath Tagore says:

“Music is the purest form of art and, therefore, the most direct expression of beauty, with form and spirit which is one and simple, and least encumbered with anything extraneous. We seem to feel that the manifestation of the Infinite in the finite forms of creation is music itself, silent and visible.”[fn:: RTMB 134,8.

I am reminded of an immortal incident in Tagore’s life. Many, many years ago he visited Bulgaria, and the Bulgarians wanted to honour him. Tagore had at that time the English translation of Gitanjali with him. But he deliberately read out his poems in Bengali. There were many, many people in the audience and they all listened to his poems in rapt attention. The audience was spellbound. Fie did not speak one word of English; he only read out his immortal Bengali poems. This was Tagore. The audience members were so moved! Tagore knew English very, very well. But how much love and admiration he received from the people of Bulgaria! Here is the proof: when you love, admire and adore someone, you do not have to understand that person with your mind. You can easily understand him with your heart.

Whenever I think of Bulgaria, I say, “Oh, I do not have to learn their language, I do not even have to speak in English. As long as I can speak in Bengali, Bulgaria will accept me.”[fn:: RTMB 135,2. August 27th, 2005. Previously unpublished.]

Mother Earth, why are you so unkind to me?
Why do I have to sow the seed, tend to the plant and nourish the plant until it becomes a tree?
Right from the beginning, can you not give me the beautiful flowers and delicious fruits?
Why do I have to work for it?

Mother Earth replies, “My child, I can do it, but you will not be happy.
When I give you food, you will get joy.
But when you struggle for it, when you work for it, you will get much more joy.
I can do everything:
I can sow the seed, and I can bring the rain.
But you will not be happy because you will not have done anything.”

If we do something, if we work hard for it, then when we achieve it, when we reach the goal, we get much more joy than otherwise.[fn:: RTMB 136,3. November 4th, 2003. Previously unpublished.]

I was told that Tagore’s voice was very sweet and melodious, but a little bit high-pitched. Ravi Shankar also mentioned the same thing in his book. Tagore’s voice was normal, but a little high. Then some of the professors at Santiniketan tried to imitate him. Their normal voices went a little higher. My mentor, Sisirkumar Ghose, was one of those who tried to imitate Tagore’s voice.

When Tagore was young and had only a few songs to his credit, he had an excellent, excellent voice. Then, when he had completed hundreds and hundreds of songs, his singing voice deserted him.

In our Indian philosophy, we have a particular goddess named Saraswati. Saraswati is the goddess of learning, the goddess of art and the goddess of inspiration. In the West, you use the term ‘muse’. As we have a human world, where we get all earthly things, even so, there is a world of inspiration. If we go deep within, we can enter into that world and find that poems are already written there. If you want to write an article, you can enter into the world of inspiration and actually see that the article is already written. Then all you have to do is copy it down in your notebook. The lines are written there on the wall, you can say -- on the inspiration-wall. You just copy them down, and they become your possession. Our greatest poet, Tagore, did this. He entered into the world of inspiration, and from there he got many poems. There is a world of poetry, a world of prose, a world for all literature that exists.[fn:: RTMB 141,1.

There was once a little boy who was very beautiful to look at and very smart, with many talents. He was talented even at a tender age. His father was very rich and well respected; he owned vast plots of land and had many, many servants. The little boy used to spend most of his time with the servants. He was the youngest in the family, and they all adored him.

One day, the boy was singing a song that he had composed himself. The song expressed the idea that “The eye cannot see You, although You are inside the eye. The heart cannot know You, although You are inside the heart.” He was singing it most soulfully, and the tune was simply excellent.

The father heard him singing from another room and was deeply moved. He asked his servants to go and bring the little boy to him. Then the father said to his youngest son, “Can you sing the song for me again?”

The boy did not often get the opportunity to come to his father, because the father was so great and very busy. He could not approach his father any time he wanted to. Although it was a great honour that his father had called him, he was also afraid of his father and he felt shy. The father said, “I am your father. Please do not feel shy. Just sing the song that you were singing before, my child.”

The boy sang a few times and the father was so deeply moved that he entered into trance. When his trance ended, the father went into his office and wrote the boy a cheque for 500 rupees. In those days, 500 rupees for a child was really something. When he gave it to the boy he said, “In the past, the Moghul Emperors used to honour talented people with great gifts. Now the Moghul Emperors are no more. But your talent is so remarkable that I know you rightfully deserve honour from the king. Unfortunately, there is no king here to honour you. But I am your father and I am giving you 500 rupees.”

The son was so excited and delighted. He ran with the cheque and showed it to the servants. The servants lifted him up into the air. They were so proud that their little hero had become such a great poet.

Indeed, this heroic soul became the poet of poets. He became India’s greatest poet ever and won the Nobel Prize. Many people have received the Nobel Prize and many poets have been honoured, but in India he remains matchless. He composed about 2,200 songs, many of which are sung all over India, including India’s national anthem /Jana Gana Mana/. Truly, Rabindranath Tagore was a creative genius who excelled in every field of the arts. In the latter part of his life, he even took up painting. As a poet, singer and playwright, he won love and respect not only in India but all over the world. He remains in the vanguard of poets for his lyrics, songs, plays and stories. India’s Tagore will eternally remain unique. In 1961 on his birthday, the whole world observed his centenary.[fn:: RTMB 143. Written January 15th, 1979.

There was once a very great man who came from a wealthy family. He was a great seeker, a seeker of the highest order, and to the whole of Bengal he was the very embodiment of truth. Countless people admired him, loved him and adored him, and felt he was a saint.

One day he took his youngest son with him on a train ride from Calcutta to Bombay. He bought a full-price ticket for himself and a half- price ticket for his son, who was eleven years old.

After the train had been going for some time, the ticket collector entered into their compartment and asked for their tickets. When he saw the half-price ticket for the boy, he was a little bit hesitant, for the boy was very tall for his age, and he looked much older than eleven years old. But the ticket collector did not say anything. He just marked the ticket and left.

After two hours, another ticket collector came. He also hesitated because he, too, thought that the boy was over twelve years old, since he was so tall and smart looking. But he did not say anything either.

After some time, these two ticket collectors brought the stationmaster to the man’s compartment, and the stationmaster asked to see the tickets. The stationmaster was so ignorant. He did not realise that this man was well known for his greatness and goodness.

By this time, the man was very upset. So many times these ticket people were bothering him! “All right, see the tickets!” he said angrily.

The stationmaster asked, “This boy is a minor? How old is he?”

The man replied, “Eleven.”

The stationmaster said, “No, you are telling me a lie.”

The man, whom all of Bengal worshipped as the embodiment of truth, said to himself, “What will you do with these ignorant people? It is useless to argue with them.” So he paid the difference in the fare to the stationmaster, saying, “Take it!”

The stationmaster gave him a full ticket for his son and returned his change. When the stationmaster gave the great man his few rupees of change, the man became so furious that he threw the money on the floor and it all scattered.

Then the stationmaster felt very embarrassed. “What a scene I created for one ticket for a young boy and a haughty old man!” he said to himself.

Because of the commotion, many people came running to see what had happened. What they saw was the great sage and saint of Bengal, Deben- dranath Tagore, Tagore’s father. And the young boy was Tagore himself.[fn:: RTMB 144. Ibid., p. 46.]

Bankim Chandra Chatterjee was Bengal’s greatest novelist. Our immortal mantra /Bande Mataram/ comes from him. That is one of our national songs, a most significant one. While repeating /Bande Mataram/, many, many patriots embraced death.

Once there was a literary meeting. People wanted Bankim Chandra to preside over the meeting. Rabindranath Tagore was supposed to attend. At that time he was still very young, and he had only written a few poems; he had not written any stories. Before the function started, the authorities garlanded Bankim Chandra because he was the greatest literary figure. When our Bankim Chandra was garlanded, he immediately took off the garland and came to where Tagore was sitting in the audience. Then Bankim Chandra placed the garland on Tagore and said, “I am the setting sun. You are the rising sun. I must honour the rising sun. I will soon take my farewell.” So happily and proudly, Bankim placed the garland around Tagore.

Look at this! Bankim Chandra’s third eye was open, and he was right. Tagore went on to write so many excellent books. Tagore became the hero supreme in Bengali literature. Even though Bankim was much older than Tagore at that time, he said, “I am the setting sun. You are the rising sun, I can see, so I must honour you.”[fn:: RTMB 145. October 30th, 2004.

Tagore was the first one to declare Mahatma Gandhi a great soul. Tagore was the one who first called him ‘Mahatma’. And then again, Mahatma called Tagore ‘Gurudev’. Tagore became Gandhi’s Gurudev, and then everybody started saying “Gurudev, Gurudev.”

These two great luminaries were so close. They loved each other deeply; they admired each other unreservedly. Once, however, they entered into a very unpleasant conversation, a terribly heated argument. Indeed, it was a shocking experience for their followers and admirers. Some took Tagore’s side, while others took Gandhi’s side.

A follower of Gandhi pleaded with the great artist Nandalal Bose to take one side. He immediately expressed his utter incapacity: “I am an artist. I like all colours deeply and equally. To me, these two supremely great souls are like two Vision-Eyes. I cannot prefer one Eye to the other. I love them deeply and need them equally.”[fn:: RTMB 146.

Rabindranath Tagore lavished boundless affection and love on Nandalal Bose, and he was also fond of the artist Mukul Dey. Mukul Dey was a great admirer and student of Nandalal Bose. Nandalal Bose and Mukul Dey went to many countries with Tagore, and Tagore liked them immensely.

Once, Nandalal Bose gave a bottle of ink to Mukul Dey and said, “This ink was made in Japan.”

In those days in India, any article from a foreign country created such fascination and was deeply appreciated. Mukul Dey was so excited and delighted. He thought, “This is such a nice thing. I will not use it. I will give it to Gurudev (meaning Tagore). He will be very happy to use this.”

Any object that is nice, people always wish to give to their dear ones. Because Mukul Dey was so fond of Tagore, he presented the ink to him.

When Tagore heard that the ink had come originally from Nandalal Bose, whom he loved so much, he used the ink to compose a poem on Nandalal Bose. Tagore wrote the whole poem, but nothing was visible on the paper. Tagore and Mukul Dey thought that it would become visible in a few hours. But hours passed by, and still nothing could be seen.

Tagore asked Mukul Dey, “What happened? Nothing is coming out. I thought that Nandalal Bose was giving us something extraordinary, an ink which becomes visible only after some time.”

Mukul Dey went to Nandalal Bose. When Bose heard that Tagore had used the ink, he was thunderstruck! He was so embarrassed. “What have I done? What have I done?” he said.

Nandalal had never expected that the ink would go to Tagore; otherwise, he would never have dared to do this kind of thing. He gave it to Mukul Dey to pull his leg, but Mukul Dey took the gift seriously and presented the gift to Tagore, of all people. But Tagore also enjoyed that joke. Afterwards, he wrote out the poem again using proper ink.[fn:: RTMB 147. Ibid., pp. 94-96.]

Mahatma Gandhi often fasted to get things done in his own way. He used to threaten to fast unto death if Nehru and others did not fulfil his desires. In 1932 Gandhi began a most serious fast to protest the British treatment of untouchables. For many days he did not eat anything. Tagore was shocked. He came all the way to Pune with folded hands and begged Gandhi to resume eating. Because it was Gurudev making the request, Gandhi listened to him and started eating.[fn:: RTMB 148.

In the evening of Tagore’s life, his beloved Santiniketan was suffering badly from lack of money. To run a university is no joke, and Tagore needed money desperately in order for the university to continue. How would he raise the necessary funds? He was at that time 74 or 75. He had the inspiration to dance for the public to make money. He said that easily he would be able to get the required amount because thousands of his admirers would come to watch his dance.

Gandhi came to hear about it and said to Tagore, “Gurudev, as long as I am on earth, I will not allow you to dance in public. Please tell me how much money you actually need.” Gandhi had so many admirers who were wealthy businessmen. They were such devoted friends that at his request they would give him millions of rupees, so Gandhi was able to give Tagore a very large amount of money. In this way, he stopped Tagore from dancing.

Why would people have come to see a dancer whose skill was not only unknown, but also very dubious? Just because he was a famous man in his own field. Although Tagore was not a dancer; as a poet, as a visionary, as a man of inner depth, he was really something extraordinary. Just to be in his presence, even if his dancing had been totally unskilled, would have been an inspiration. His inner capacity, his inspiration and his aspiration would have elevated the consciousness of his audience. There are many really good, excellent dancers, but in the matter of inner depth or inner height they come nowhere near the standard of this poet. Of course, I am not criticising other dancers for their lack of inner depth. As artists in their own fields, they may be excellent. But because of what this beloved seer-poet had contributed in the field of poetry, because of what he was as a man, his very presence could elevate the consciousness of his admirers, although he might have been nowhere in the field of dancing. When one is really great in some field, others are not the losers if they spend a few hours with him in another field, although it may be totally foreign to his original area.[fn:: RTMB 149. Ibid.

Tagore had two or three devoted students who were great artists. His nephew, Abanindranath, was number one. He was the greatest. And he learnt this kind of artwork from the British. The British ruled us, true. But, at the same time, they taught us many, many good things. Another artist’s name was Mukul Dey. His young daughter used to dance. Tagore came to learn that Mukul Dey’s daughter knew how to dance, so he was inspired to introduce dancing at Santiniketan.

In those days, dancing was not viewed favourably. However Tagore was a revolutionary; he could do anything. This little girl danced in public, while some people sang. And the audience was full of appreciation. Unfortunately, Tagore gained quite a few enemies as well because dancing was frowned upon by many people. In the course of time, dancing in India became so popular. In South India, they perform Bharat Natyam dances, which are very, very devotional.[fn:: RTMB 150. Ibid.]

Rabindranath Tagore showed his nobility many, many times. This is one most significant incident.

Dilip Roy’s father, Dwijendra Lai Roy, composed many national songs which are extremely soulful, powerful and authentic. Immediately they bring tears to your eyes. Your tears will be found not only inside your eyes but inside your heart as well. The whole of Bengal is flooded with D.L. Roy’s patriotic songs. He wrote quite a few supremely beautiful songs to arouse the slumbering sub-continent. Love of his country welled forth from his heart like a fountain. One of his most famous songs is ‘Bharat Amar\ According to me, this is one of our most beautiful, most powerful and most meaningful national songs. No Bengali villager will be ignorant of this song. He also wrote many, many plays.

In the beginning, Tagore and D.L. Roy were good friends but, unfortunately, in human life friendship does not last. They became rivals and then they virtually became enemies, and Tagore gave up going to D.L. Roy’s house.

Dilip’s mother died when he was only six years old and he was brought up by his father. Alas, his father passed away in 1913, when Dilip was sixteen. By that time, Tagore had become so great. Dilip had the strongest desire to meet with Tagore and, at the same time, he knew that Tagore and his father had been at daggers drawn. How could he go and seek Tagore’s blessing? Dilip did not dare to go and visit him.

One very famous Bengali novelist, Sarat Chandra Chatterjee, wanted to put an end to this unhappy situation. He had tremendous affection for Dilip and he was also close to Tagore. Tagore once confessed that, as a novelist, he was no match for Sarat Chandra.

This great writer took up the challenge. He said to Dilip, “Dilip, do not worry. Tagore will forgive you; he will hold nothing against you.” Dilip said to Sarat Chandra, “My father and Tagore were on such bad terms. Will Tagore agree to see me?”

Sarat Chandra assured him, “You are young. I am sure he will see you.”

Full of fear, Dilip went with Sarat Chandra to Tagore’s place. Dilip was then still in his adolescent years. The young boy said to Tagore, “My father is gone. Can we not be reconciled?”

Then Tagore completely forgot his ill feeling against Dilip’s father; his magnanimous heart did not carry any animosity towards the son. On the contrary, he lavished all his kindness, affection, love and blessings on Dilip.

Dilip’s nickname was Mantu, and Tagore used to call him Mantu. My brother’s nickname was also Mantu. Tagore was compassion incarnate. He encouraged Dilip in so many ways, and Dilip visited him many times at Santiniketan and other places. This is how Sarat Chandra solved the problem.

In a letter to Dilip, Tagore wrote: “I have a sincere affection for you. My heart is attracted by your unmixed truthfulness and frankness.”

This was Tagore’s great nobility. Everybody will remember Tagore’s greatness.[fn:: RTMB 153. This story and the next are from: Sri Chinmoy, My Dilip-Da-Adoration, New York: Agni Press, 2007, pp. 49-55 and pp. 7-8.]

Dilip Roy had so many illumining conversations with Tagore. He used to visit Santiniketan for a few days, and they would talk and talk. They also enjoyed their voluminous correspondence.

One conversation was so striking. Dilip was fearless. He said to Tagore, “Kabiguru [Guru of the poets], why do you not allow others to set music to your songs? Forgive me, but they could give better melodies to your most beautiful words. Why not allow them? They are great singers. They will do a far better job. Your own melodies are so simple.”

Tagore responded, “Look, I give much more importance to my words than to my music. I am totally identified with the words. Words convey what I have from within. Words convey my feelings. When I write, words come to me first. Then the melody I give. Melodies do not convey feeling. Even if others can give better melodies to my songs, I will not allow them because I know the words convey my feeling. They come from me directly. They give me such a sweet feeling. Words are so important in my life.” This was Tagore.

Then, a few years later, to somebody else, Tagore said about his poems which were set to music, “My words are like widows. But when they are set to music, they become like brides, most beautiful. When music comes, it is like a beautiful girl with all kinds of ornaments. But if the poem remains only as words, then it is like an Indian widow. The words have to give up all their beauty.”

In those days, Indian widows could not have beauty. They had to cut off their hair, they could not wear jewellery and they had to lead an austere life. They became simplicity incarnate. They were all the time mourning the loss of their husbands.

To Dilip Roy, Tagore said that words came first, he did not care for melody; and then to somebody else he said that without melody a poem is like a widow -- there is no beauty, no charm. He changed his opinion. He gave two versions, and I have read both.

At one point, we have no idea when, that fountain will be fully, fully awakened.

Realisation is our discovery that we are not finite but infinite. In realisation, we come to know that it is inside the finite that the Infinite is playing its tune. Tagore, India’s greatest poet, said,

You are playing Your own Tune.
I am a tiny body;
Inside my finite body,
You play Your infinite Melody.

God is both inside the Infinite and also inside the finite. But it is very difficult to imagine or to think of God when we see a tiny object, say a grain of sand. For us, to think of God inside that tiny grain is very difficult. But if we think of the Himalayas or something very majestic, then it is quite easy for us to think and feel that God is there.

When the Infinite plays through the finite, it uses the finite as its instrument. When the finite can claim the Infinite as its very own in the field of realisation and in the field of manifestation, then only can God the Infinite and God the finite -- God in Heaven and God on earth -- become totally fulfilled.[fn:: RTMB 161.

On the 24th of November 2004, I had a most significant inner experience. My students and I were staying in Shanghai, China, for one day during our annual Christmas trip. There, around one-thirty in the afternoon, I was meditating. I was in very, very deep trance in my meditation. I was in my very highest. Alas, my fever-journey had started. My fever was extremely high, almost 104 degrees. It was as if I were inside boiling water.

At that time, when I was physically suffering, who came to me? Tagore’s soul. Previously also, his soul had come many, many times. This time we had a marathon conversation. We were exchanging our views and so forth. Then, like rain, his advice was descending on me. Next he made a few requests. He wanted me to write down 1,000 of my poems in my own handwriting. I said, “No, those days are gone. My handwriting has become illegible. Your handwriting was superb. My handwriting is no match for your handwriting.”

At first I declined his request, but he did not accept my refusal. Then I started to fulfil his request, which was almost an impossibility for me. Tagore’s handwriting was so artistic. Mine is simple, but quite nice. In my schooldays, I used to get four out of four for my handwriting. But, in all sincerity, his handwriting is far, far better than mine. He wanted me to write down 1,000 songs in Bengali. Impossible, impossible!

Then I said, “One hundred I will try.” Alas, I did only fourteen. God alone knows if and when I will be able to write down one hundred -- and one thousand will be an impossibility! To abide by this request, even though it comes from our greatest poet, is a most difficult task for me.

Such a long interview, a very long interview, we had! Tagore’s soul came to bless me and encourage me. I had brought with me to China his /Gitanjali/ in Bengali, plus some of his songs. As soon as I saw his face on the cover of /Gitanjali/, it gave me so much inspiration. Such a beautiful beard and such luminous eyes he had! His picture gave me real inspiration. From the joy and inspiration that I received from him, I wrote a song about him, a very soulful song. It is called /‘Dhyane Tanamoy’/. Then I was so inspired that about twenty minutes later I composed three more Bengali songs: /‘Bangalir Gan’ ‘Bangalir Pran’/, and /‘Ekti Bangali’/. It is all Rabindranath Tagore’s advice, inspiration and encouragement. These are the songs I composed on that most significant day in my life.

Chinmoy was in a very deep trance.
Tagore, the King of Poets, came to visit him.
With very soft eyes, and tremendous care and concern,
He blessed Chinmoy with torrential advice-rain.[fn:: RTMB 162. Previously unpublished. Comments and song translation provided by the author on several occasions, especially January 2nd, 2005 and February 18th, 2005.]

Chinmoy Kumar Ghose, known the world over as Sri Chinmoy, was born on August 27th, 1931, in the small village of Shakpura, East Bengal. At the age of twelve, after the passing of his parents, he joined his older brothers and sisters at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry, South India. There he practised intense spiritual disciplines and also participated in the rich literary and cultural life of the Ashram.

When he was a young boy, his inner experiences found spontaneous expression in poetry and songs. Initially, he wrote in the flowing rhythms and beautiful cadence of his native Bengali. Later he sought out the formal eloquence and power of the English language.

Sri Chinmoy attained the highest spiritual realisation in his early teens. At the age of 32, he received a Call from Above to go to the West and be of service to sincere Truth-seekers and God-lovers. He arrived in New York on April 13th, 1964. It was to become his home for the rest of his life.

During the next four decades, Sri Chinmoy portrayed mankind’s deepest aspirations through literature, music and art. Significantly, Siddhartha Shankar Ray, India’s Ambassador to the United States at the time, said of him in 1995: “Sri Chinmoy is a multi-faceted genius, a multi-splendoured personality, and also a poet, artist, musician, athlete, as well as a spiritual guide. He is an embodiment of Rabindranath Tagore’s immortal concept of the universal man.” On October 11th, 2007, after a lifetime of service to humanity, Sri Chinmoy passed behind the curtain of Eternity.

The year 2011 is supremely auspicious for lovers of literature and music around the world, for it is the 150th birth anniversary of the great Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore.

Tagore holds a unique place in the hearts of all Indians and Bangladeshis. In 1913 he became the first Bengali to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, and he is the composer of the national anthem for each of these countries. In addition, his songs -- filled with love for nature’s beauty and praise of the Divine -- are sung in towns and villages throughout the sub-continent even today.

In this volume, the great spiritual Master Sri Chinmoy, also hailing from East Bengal and himself an enormously prolific poet, expresses his life-long appreciation and admiration for Tagore. From the age of four, when he was growing up in Shakpura, East Bengal, until his final years, he never tired of singing and listening to Tagore’s songs. Throughout his life, in fact, Sri Chinmoy drew tremendous inspiration from Tagore, and his outpouring of poetry, music and paintings in many ways recalls Tagore’s own seemingly limitless creative fountain.

These writings by Sri Chinmoy about Rabindranath Tagore are gathered from his poems, songs, essays, stories and reflections spanning more than four decades. May they encourage readers from West and East alike to immerse themselves in the immortal treasures of this Master-Poet whom Sri Chinmoy praises so exquisitely as “Banger hiya chand” -- “The Moon of Bengal’s Heart.”
