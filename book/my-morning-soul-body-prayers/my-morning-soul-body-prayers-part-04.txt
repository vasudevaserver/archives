Thirty-five years ago
I came from India -- the Old World --
To America -- the New World.
   Before I left,
I prayed to the soul of India
   To bless me.
The soul of India compassionately
   And tearfully
Fulfilled my desire.
On my arrival here in America,
I prayed to the heart of America
   To embrace me.
The heart of America smilingly
   And unreservedly embraced me.

My Supreme, my Supreme, my Supreme!
You are telling me
That a seeker does not need
Strict spiritual disciplines.
He does not need austerities.
He does not need the highest
   And deepest meditation.
What he needs to realise You
Is only pure, pure, pure devotion.
You are also telling me
That all are equal in Your Sight,
But those who have sincere
   Devotion to You
Have a very, very special place
   In Your Heart,
And their hearts
   Are Your choicest homes.
My Supreme, my Supreme, my Supreme!
