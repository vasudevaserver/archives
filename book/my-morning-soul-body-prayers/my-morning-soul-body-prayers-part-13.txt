My Supreme, my Supreme, my Supreme!
My mind whispers to me:
"God is always busy.
I am sure He is not going to come
And visit you."
My heart whispers to me:
"God loves you so much.
Look, He is coming to visit you!"

My Supreme, my Supreme, my Supreme!
God does not want me to carry
A credit card.
He wants me to carry always with me
The mighty dollar
To remind me that I am, indeed,
A child of the Almighty.
My Lord, will people not laugh
At my cleverness?
"My child, cleverness is far better
Than foolishness.
When you use your cash, your inner pride
And the cashier's inner joy
Sing, play and dance together."
Finally, God becomes serious.
He tells me, "My child,
Money-power conquers only the inferiors.
Heart-power conquers everybody --
The superiors, the inferiors
And the equals,
Plus Me and My All."
My Supreme, my Supreme, my Supreme!
