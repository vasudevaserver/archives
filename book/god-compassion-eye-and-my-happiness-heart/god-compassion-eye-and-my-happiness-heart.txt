My Lord Beloved Supreme,
What happens when I obey You
And when I don't obey You?
"My child,
When you obey Me,
You think that I gain much from you,
But I gain nothing, absolutely nothing.
But when you disobey Me,
You lose everything that you have
And you are in the inner world
Where real reality abides.
In the inner world
You are not even a match
For a street beggar."

My Lord Beloved Supreme,
I do not have love-garden for You today.
I do not have devotion-flower for You today.
I do not have surrender-fragrance for You today.
I do not have gratitude-tears and smiles
For You today.
But will You not give me another chance,
Another day,
To give You all these and anything more
That I have deep within
And I am not aware of?
My Lord,
No matter what I say,
No matter what I do,
I know that You are all mine,
Only mine,
And I am Yours, only Yours.

There is no holiday for a God-lover
Who longs to love God
In God's own Way.
There is no holiday for a God-server
Who longs to serve God
In God's own Way.
Why?
Because God Himself does not want them
To have holidays.
God says:
"Each holiday can easily
Become a prey to a new Temptation-frustration-destruction-day."
