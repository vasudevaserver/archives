You want to change the world
To satisfy yourself.
What you want
Is nothing but satisfaction.
Such being the case,
Why don't you change yourself?
Your own transformation,
I assure you,
Will never give you
A lesser satisfaction.
On the contrary,
Your transformation will give you
Not only the satisfaction
That you deserve
But also the infinite Satisfaction
That God eternally is.
