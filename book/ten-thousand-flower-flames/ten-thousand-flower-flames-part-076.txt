Your mind may resent you
Because nowadays you are paying
Less attention to it.
But do not be a fool.
Do not again become a good friend
Of your mind.
Eventually there will come a time
When you will pay no attention at all
To your desire-bound, doubt-bound mind.
That will be the time
When you and your faith,
Like two little children,
Will play inside the garden
Of your soul.
