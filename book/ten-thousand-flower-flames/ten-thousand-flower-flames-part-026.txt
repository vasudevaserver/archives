You are now dying to forget
Quite a few chapters.
You need some help.
Lo, God's Forgiveness-Magic Wand
Is poised right over your head.

The sincere capacity to doubt
Your own proud assessment
That the path is false.

That poor Heaven embodies.

This is the twenty-sixth volume in a series of ten thousand “flaming flower-poems” which Sri Chinmoy is placing devotedly, unreservedly and unconditionally at the Compassion-Feet of God, our Beloved Supreme. They stand as a supreme offering from the unfolding beauty of his flower-heart and the flaming heights of his realisation-sun. Indeed, a treasure-tower which will at once be claimed by humanity’s self-ascending cry and Divinity’s God-descending Smile.
