Who says that I am alone?
Am I not with the broken wings
Of my hopes
Inside the abyss of darkness?
Who says that tomorrow
I shall be alone again?
No, I shall not!
Tomorrow my entire earthly existence
Will swim in the sea of God-Delight.
How?
I do not know.
But it is all God-planned
And God-arranged.

My Lord Supreme,
Do grant me a boon.
"My child, I am giving you the boon
To come near Me selflessly."

My Lord Supreme,
Do grant me another boon.
"My child, I am giving you another boon:
To see the world
The way I see the world."

My Lord Supreme,
May I have one more boon,
A last boon, from You?
"Certainly, My child.
I shall make you
My perfect emissary on earth,
To become inseparably one
With earth's excruciating pangs
And streaming tears
The way I have been doing
Throughout My entire Eternity."
