The game of insincerity and guilt.
Can you not now play a different game,
The game of insincerity and sincerity?
And after some time
Can you not start playing
An altogether new game?
This will be your last game:
The game of sincerity and surrender.

This is the thirtieth volume in a series of ten thousand “flaming flower-poems” which Sri Chinmoy is placing devotedly, unreservedly and unconditionally at the Compassion-Feet of God, our Beloved Supreme. They stand as a supreme offering from the unfolding beauty of his flower-heart and the flaming heights of his realisation-sun. Indeed, a treasure-tower which will at once be claimed by humanity’s self-ascending cry and Divinity’s God-descending Smile.
