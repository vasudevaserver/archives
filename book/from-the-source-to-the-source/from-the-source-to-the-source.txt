* Dedication

Right from my infancy my brother Chitta has inspired me, encouraged me and taught me lovingly and unreservedly how to devotedly and successfully enter into the poetry-world. Therefore today with my heart's boundless gratitude I am offering my seeker-poet's flower-gathering to him, the Source of my poetry-world.

Time and again
You desired to fell
Your weak life-tree.
Time and again
You failed to succeed.
Your great Captain
Would fain
Ring departure-bell
When the hour strikes.
Until then proceed
With God-Beauty
In your body's cell.
