When I pray to God,
I fold my hands and bring them
Right up to my chest
And try to hear my heartbeat.
I look upward to find a spot
Ten feet, at least,
Higher than my head level.
When I have completed all this,
I start praying.
To tell the truth, I get fantastic results!

When I meditate on God,
I do the same thing with my hands,
Only instead of looking upward,
I look inward.
I look into my heart and then I look
For a secret and sacred, silent spot
Inside my heart.
When all this is done,
I start meditating.
I tell you, the results are unimaginable.

“I also need another favour
From you:
You will tell your parents
How happy and grateful
You are to them
For bringing you into this world.
Still one more favour I need,
And this is the last favour
You will have to do for Me,
My child.
You will have to claim Me
All the time,
Not missing a second,
As your own, very own.“

God, I have already started.
