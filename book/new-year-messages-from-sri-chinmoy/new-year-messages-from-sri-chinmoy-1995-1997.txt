My Lord, my Lord, my Lord! \\
“My child, My child, My child!”

My Lord, my Supreme Lord, my only Lord!

This year my heart’s streaming gratitude-tears have given me the unimaginable capacity to place at Your Forgiveness-Feet the sweet bloom of my love, the pure blossom of my devotion and the true fragrance of my surrender.

“My child, My Infinity’s Dream-child, My Immortality’s Reality-child, this year I shall grow in you with My unfailing Newness Hope-Sky and I shall shine through you with My rising Fulness-Promise-Sun.”

My Lord, I am /perfect/ only when I have Your Happiness-Heart as my sleepless Companion. \\
“My child, I am /complete/ only when I have your oneness-life as My breathless companion.”

My Lord, my only Lord, this year to You, only to You, \\
I shall offer My Victory’s crown.

“My child, you, only you, are My Victory’s Throne.”

This is the year of the soul’s dream-bloom-surprises and the heart’s reality-blossom-astonishments.

The helplessness of the mind is nowhere. The hopelessness of the heart is nowhere. The uselessness of the life is nowhere.

The readiness of the inspiration-world-mind says to God: “Lord, I shall come.” The willingness of the aspiration-world-heart says to God: “Lord, I am coming.” The eagerness of the dedication-world-life says to God: “Lord, I am come.”

God blessingfully and proudly asks the real God-dreamer-mind to sing, the /real/ God-lover-heart to dance, and the /real/ God-server-life to smile and fly, fly and smile.

The slow and long years of humanity’s hope-heart shall begin to transform into humanity’s fulfilment-life.

The beauty of world-peace was a sweet dream.

The fragrance of world-peace shall begin to become a fruitful reality.

At long last the body shall offer its readiness, the vital shall offer its willingness, the mind shall offer its eagerness and the heart shall offer its oneness to the soul’s God-Light-Manifestation and God-Delight-Satisfaction-tasks here on earth.

Earth’s heart is smiling. \\
Heaven’s Heart is singing. \\
Earth’s breath is singing. \\
Heaven’s breath is dancing.

I am saying to my Absolute Lord Beloved Supreme: “Father, my Father, I now have You.”

My Absolute Lord Beloved Supreme is saying to me: “Child, my Child, you now I am.”

Peace, PEACE, Peace

My Peace is not the end of world wars.
My Peace is not the end of world-suffering.
My Peace is not the end of world ignorance.

Peace, PEACE, Peace

My Peace is the blooming beauty of my heart.
My Peace is the blossoming fragrance of my soul.
My Peace is my sleepless and breathless ONENESS
With the Will of my Absolute Lord Beloved Supreme.

    My Lord Beloved Absolute Supreme
 The sweet beginning of a new-dream-life —-
  The pure blooming of a new-hope-heart —-
The sure blossoming of a new-promise-soul —-

Humanity’s self-discovery-boat shall ply
              Between
    Earth’s newness-cry-shore
                 And
   Heaven’s Fulness-Smile-Shore.

    The Absolute Lord Supreme
Tells the confusion-mind of the world:
    “Take My Sadness-Heart and Madness-Eye
As the last and urgent Warning.
    Come back Home immediately!”

    The Beloved Lord Supreme
Tells the aspiration-heart of the world:
    “In you is
My World-Transrormation-Hope-Dream,
    With you is
My Self-Transcendence-Vision-Manifestation-Promise
    And for you is
My Smile-Beauty-Fragrance-Presence.”

    The Year Two Thousand
Is a decision-examination for humanity:
            Either
We bind and blind the old world, and retire
            Or
We embrace the new world of the forward march.
   The Smile of the Beyond
   Is beckoning us
   To come and play hide-and-seek.

Uncertainty-supremacy assails the world.
God’s secret and sacred Will
In the world of the unknowable prevails.

The New Millennium is humanity’s unhorizoned
God-surrender-victory
       And
Divinity’s most glorious earth-blossom-discovery.

My Absolute Lord Beloved Supreme,
Please tell me what is going to happen
   In this New Year.
“My child, keep quiet.
With My Transcendental Vision,
I shall give humanity
A new hope,
A new promise
            And
A new receptivity-acceptance of life.
All the aspiring human beings here on earth
   Must join Me.
I shall succeed.
I am bound to succeed.”

A blue-gold hope-bird is flying
In the heart-sky of humanity.

The Golden Shore is beckoning
The blooming God-life-seekers
                    And
The blossoming God-heart-lovers.

Before long, the world-mind-uncertainty
Will be buried in oblivion.

Before long, the world-heart-certainty
Shall start reigning supreme.

The mind’s power-drum is surrendering
To the sweetness-flute of the heart.

The oneness-peace-realities shall devour
The world-division-hunger-dreams.
