Pride

Pride destroys our satisfaction-beauty in the inner world and our perfection-reality in the outer world.

Endless

When I love only God unconditionally, endless is my satisfaction-delight. When I love only myself sleeplessly, endless is my frustration-destruction.

Demon

The demons consciously make us feel how weak and helpless we are in their strong presence. The demons unconsciously make us feel our sleepless and deathless oneness with the Inner Pilot, our Beloved Supreme.

Horse sacrifice

In India the horse sacrifice grants us tremendous name and fame, but satisfaction may remain a far cry. Oneness-realisation will grant us not only boundless satisfaction but also the message of ever-transcending perfection.

Initiation

Initiation is divinely meaningful and supremely fruitful. During initiation the crying heart of the disciple says to the Master, "I need you badly." The loving heart of the Master says to the disciple, "I shall not only love you unreservedly but also give to you unconditionally."

One who initiates

The one who initiates knows where his realisation is coming from. He knows also to whom he is offering it. His realisation is coming from his Father Transcendental and going to his brother, who is crying to be a conscious part of the Universal Reality.

This

This world may frighten and discourage the God-seeker, but it can never, never remotely frighten or discourage a true God-lover, for he sees God the creation and God the Creator as one indivisible Reality.

This world is beautiful if we see the Creator in it. This world is fruitful if we add to it our own aspiration-cry and dedication-smile.
