I dedicate this book to my Savyasachi, Chetana, Ranjana, Aradhana and Sumedha. They have graciously and sincerely told me that my command of English surpasses theirs. To tell the truth, the words in this book have tremendously enriched my own vocabulary. I do hope that this book of amusement will inspire some of my disciple-readers who want to increase their vocabulary and sail in the same boat as we are in. The two brothers and the kind readers have all one Soul, one Role and one Goal: “Smile and learn, learn and smile.”

/Madal:/

Chinmoy, when I become a victim to an /abject/ mood, what should I do for a quick relief?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, when you are suffering from /spiritless/ boredom, just go and mix with your spiritual friends who are bubbling with energy. They will immediately cure you.



* 2. Abnegation

  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, is it necessary for me to live a life of /abnegation/?

/Chinmoy:/

No, Madal, you don't have to live a life of /self-denial/. What you should do is to live a life of vital purification until you grow into a life of self-realisation and God-manifestation.



* 3. Abominate

  :PROPERTIES:

  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, whom to abominate and what to /abominate/?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, whom to /hate/? None. What to hate? Doubt -- today, tomorrow and always.



* 4. Abort

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:4
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, some of your close disciples want to open up an Ashram for you. Needless to say, their desire is extremely sincere. How is it that their desire is /aborted/?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, their desire /fails/ because God's chosen Hour for us to open up an Ashram has not yet struck.



* 5. Abrogate

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse

  :cite-key: TBMC:5
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, is there any way I can /abrogate/ my agreement with Fate?

/Chinmoy:/

Yes, Madal, you can /cancel/ your agreement with fa fate if you consciously feel that you are of God and for God.



* 6. Abscond

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:6
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, in the spiritual life can one /abscond/ from the home of doubt?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, to try to /go away secretly/ and suddenly from the home of doubt is impossible. Instead of running away secretly, one should break down the house of doubt with one's strong faith in God.



* 7. Acme

  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:7
  :END:

Madal, the /highest point/ of perfection lies in self-giving and God-manifesting.



* 8. Acrimonious

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:8
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, it seems that the scientist and the spiritualist enjoy a continual /acrimonious/ argument over the existence or non-existence of God. Why do they do so?

/Chinmoy:/

Alas, Madal, I know, I know; both the scientist and the spiritualist enjoy /bitter/ arguments. They are in habit of doing so because they both feel that they alone are right. I must add that according to the inner development of these two rivals, each one is right. Let us not worry, the real seeker in the scientist will one day come forward and then it will not be difficult for the scientist to shake hands with the spiritualist.



* 9. Acumen

  :cite-key: TBMC:9
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, are you not proud of your /acumen/?

/Chinmoy:/

No, Madal, I am not proud of my /keen insight/. I am proud only of God's constant Light and Vision which He lends to me.



* 10. Adamant

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:10
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, what makes you so /adamant/ at times in your decisions with regard to your spiritual children?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, what makes me /absolutely firm/ is my inseparable oneness with divinity's Light. And this Light will never allow me or my disciples to yield to the love of ignorance-night.



* 11. Adjudicate

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:11
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, when there is a sad dispute between outer doubt and inner faith, who can /adjudicate/?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, when your doubt and your faith are in dispute, the absolutely sincere aspirant in you must come forward to /settle/ the dispute.



* 12. Aesthetic.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:12
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, is it absolutely necessary for a seeker to develop an /aesthetic/ sense?

/Chinmoy:/

Yes, Madal, a spiritual person has to be /sensitive to beauty/. His aspiring life undoubtedly needs both inner and outer beauty.



* 13. Affinity

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:13
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, the two divine qualities, love and devotion, do they have an /affinity/ for each other?

/Chinmoy:/

Yes, Madal, love and devotion have a great /mutual attraction/ and feeling for each other. Love fulfils devotion with its wisdom. Devotion fulfils love with its delight.



* 14. Affront

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:14
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, does God feel it as an /affront/ when someone speaks ill of Him?

/Chinmoy:/

No, Madal, God does not feel it as an /insult/ when someone speaks ill of Him. God's Mind is all concern for man. His Heart is all compassion for man. You are following the spiritual life. Just wait a few years. You yourself will not feel insulted if someone speaks ill of you.



* 15. Alacrity

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse

  :cite-key: TBMC:15
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, dark depression has been calling me for the last few months. My heavy mind does not allow me to achieve anything with /alacrity/. I need your advice badly.

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, just think that you are good, just feel that you are great, just realise that you are divine. Lo, the train of depression has gone. Lo, the plane of illumination is come. God now gives you a new name: /cheerful quickness and dynamism/.



* 16. Altruism

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:16
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, is it at all possible for any human being to have a genuine sense of /altruism/ in this power-hungry world?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, it is quite possible. When we show a /noble concern/ for others and treasure /unselfishness/, we grow into the Light of Divinity. Let us try. We all will, without fail, succeed.



* 17. Ameliorate

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:17
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, how can one most effectively /ameliorate/ the conditions of those who are suffering from inner poverty?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, one can most effectively /relieve/ their inner poverty by giving them inner strength and outer encouragement.



* 18. Anathema

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:18
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, I am sure no disciple of yours drinks, for it is /anathema/ to you.

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, you are right. No true disciple of mine will ever drink. It is not at all true that drinking is /despised/ by me. But I do feel that drink is extremely harmful to the body. That is why my disciples abstain from drinking.



* 19. Anomaly

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:19
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, you often move around with your Indian shorts and Indian robes. What do your disciples think of you? Are you not an /anomaly/ in New York city?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, strangely enough I myself have asked them the same question. They have said to me that, although I /deviate from the usual/ and I am not like them in my outer way of life, they like my cute Indianism, for they love my Indian heart.



* 20. Antipathy

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:20
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy. do you have any disciples whose /antipathy/ for you is great?

/Chinmoy:/

Yes, Madal, unfortunately there are quite a few. I tell you, Madal, that either their /dislike/ of me will take them away from my boat or, seated in my boat, they will discover and realise that I am after all not such a bad boatman.



* 21. Antithesis

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:21
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, what is the /antithesis/ of human failure?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, the /opposite/ of human failure is divine success and you can get this divine success constantly if you lead a life of self-giving.



* 22. Apathy

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:22
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, your /apathy/ towards your undeveloped disciples at times borders on cruelty.

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, it seems that your mind and your heart are not functioning together. It is your own mind's ignorant wisdom that accuses me of /lack of feeling/ for my so-called undeveloped disciples.



* 23. Apposite

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:23
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, for a disciple what is the most /apposite/ way of speaking to his Guru?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, for a disciple the most /appropriate/ way of speaking to his Guru is through loving oneness and never through fear.



* 24. Apprise

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:24
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, when a disciple of yours is about to die, are you /apprised/ by the soul of this in advance?

/Chinmoy:/

Yes, Madal, I am /informed/ well in advance. As a matter of fact, I know long before the fatal hour strikes. Without the express sanction of the Supreme and my fully conscious awareness of the incident, no disciple-soul of mine can ever leave the body.



* 25. Aspersion

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:25
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, among your disciples, is there anyone who has cast /aspersions/ on you when he is speaking to others about you?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, I don't think that any of them would /slander me/. First of all, my disciples are not so unkind. And then I am also not as bad as you think.



* 26. Assiduous

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:26
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, I think in India you were an /assiduous/ reader and here in America you are anything but that.

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, you are absolutely right. In India I was a /constant and persistent/ book-reader. Needless to say, my kind-hearted God made me that. Now the same kind-hearted God has made me, here in the West, a constant and persistent mind-reader. The book-reader in me has made a total and unconditional surrender to the mind-reader in me.



* 27. Assuage

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:27
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, how can I /assuage/ my inner suffering?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, you can /lessen and soothe/ your inner suffering by feeling that God thinks of you, God cares for you and God loves you,



* 28. Auspicious

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:28
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, what is the most /auspicious/ day for a disciple? What is the most auspicious day for the Master?

/Chinmoy:/
Madal, the most /lucky, promising and fulfilling/ day for the disciple is when the Master accepts him as his very own. And the most lucky, promising and fulfilling day for the Master is when he offers God-Realisation to the disciple.



* 29. Autonomous

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:29
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, why don't you allow your Centres to be /autonomous/?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, you want my disciples in our Centres to be /self-governing/? You want them to be free from my control? For God's sake, my dear Madal, you should know that it is they who do not want to govern themselves and it is they who come to realise the fact that the Supreme in me will be able to guide them most effectively and successfully. Finally, it is they who, unlike you, feel that they and I are inseparably one. So the question of self-government on their part does not arise at all. Madal, thank you for this grand question.



* 30. Banal

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:30
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, have you ever bored your audiences with /banal/ talks?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, I am sure I have done it quite a few times, if not each time I give a talk at a university and other places. But, thanks to the unconditional kindness and forgiveness of my audience, nobody -- not even once -- has told me that my talk was /uninspiring, commonplace and ordinary/.



* 31. Bellicose

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:31
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, shall we punish or forgive those political leaders whose /bellicose/ utterances are destroying the world?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, unfortunately, we have neither the power to punish nor the power to forgive their /warlike and hostile/ utterances. But we have ample power to pray to God to change their nature.



* 32. Benign

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:32
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, do you always greet your disciples with a /benign/ smile?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, I try always to greet my disciples with a /gracious and benevolent/ smile. Sometimes I succeed and sometimes I fail miserably.



* 33. Bestial

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:33
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, in the past some Indian spiritual Masters were almost /bestial/. I simply cannot imagine how they could behave in that way towards their spiritual children. Please tell me why they were like that.

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, unfortunately even now there are many Eastern and Western spiritual Masters who are extremely /cruel and violent/ to their children. It is, as you said, incredible. However, the reason is very simple. These spiritual Masters do not care for the transformation of their own nature at all. A Yogi without the transformation of his outer nature will be able to manifest only very little of his inner divinity on earth.



* 34. Bilk

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:34
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, among your disciples is there anybody who consciously /bilks/ you?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, perhaps not. If anybody /deceives/ me consciously and deliberately, then God will not shower joy, concern and pride on him.



* 35. Blatant

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:35
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, is God not sick of our constant, /blatant/ ignorance?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, no He is not. He sincerely feels that it is His duty to free us from /clear and obvious/ ignorance. Our sincere heart tells us that we are hopeless. God's compassionate Heart tells Him that we are helpless.



* 36. Braggadocio

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:36
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, among your disciples is there anyone who derives immense pleasure from /braggadocio/?

/Chinmoy:/

Yes, Madal, I have not one, but quite a few disciples who enjoy /empty boasting/. But I can't blame them in the least, for, after all, as the saying goes, "like spiritual father, like spiritual children".



* 37. Cacophony

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:37
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, no matter what type of music I hear, it sounds to me like a /cacophony/.

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, if music sounds a /harmful noise/ to you, then you must soulfully pray to God to give you an ear for music.



* 38. Cajole

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:38
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, when someone /cajoles/ you to do something, do you like it?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, when someone /begs and teases/ me, I do like it; nay, I simply love it, far beyond your imagination.



* 39. Candour

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:39
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, do you appreciate the /candour/ of your disciples when they tell you all about their vital difficulties and weaknesses?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, not only do I appreciate them, but I simply adore their /frankness/. Their sincerity is their safeguard. That is the only way they can empty themselves and I can fill them with purity's Light and divinity's Pride.



* 40. Cant

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:40
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, I have a professor friend. Whenever he talks I feel that his utterances are full of /cant/. What shall I do with him?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, if you know that your professor friend is full of /insincerity/ and his /meaningless utterances/ are creating problems for you, then you should pray to God either to change your professor friend's nature or to free your life from his friendship.



* 41. Caprice

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:41
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, among your friends and acquaintances does anybody think that it was just a /caprice/ that took you away from the Eastern shore to live on the Western shore?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, if anybody thinks that it was a sheer /whim/, an abrupt and unmotivated decision and not an express command from my Inner Pilot, the Supreme, then I am afraid my sweet and devoted Western spiritual children, not to speak of my fanatic disciples, will without fail, sue that person in the Supreme Court.



* 42. Castigate

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:42
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, in the spiritual life, how many things must we /castigate/?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, in the spiritual life, there are only two things we must severely /criticise/: self-doubt and self-indulgence.



* 43. Cerebration

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:43
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, there was a time when you spent or wasted much time in athletics. Did you then care for /cerebration/ at all?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, I think I did. My mind was never a stranger to serious /thinking/. My spiritual life, my literary life and my athletic life ran triumphantly if not always perfectly.



* 44. Chagrin

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:44
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, my /chagrin/ becomes most intense when I see that all my friends have surpassed me in meditation.

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, your /embarrassment/ is totally unnecessary. Each disciple has to progress at his own speed.



* 45. Charlatan

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:45
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, I need not tell you that there are many gurus I who are /charlatans/ of the first water. How can we get I rid of them?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, God does not want you to get rid of the spiritual I masters who are /frauds and fakes/. God wants you only to I remain seated at the feet of the genuine spiritual teacher I and be protected, guided and illumined by him.



* 46. Chicanery

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:46
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, I am curious to know from you why a great spiritual Master like Sri Krishna had to display a certain amount of /chicanery/.

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, may God bless your curiosity since I can't. First of all, what you call Sri Krishna's /trickery/, I call an unavoidable necessity. Secondly, the human in us cannot judge the divine Sri Krishna. There was an ultimate and divine purpose behind everything he said and did. The divine in us will gladly justify him whom you call Krishna the trickster.



* 47. Circumspect

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:47
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, how can I be more /circumspect/ in my spiritual life?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, you can be more /cautious/ in your spiritual life if each action of yours becomes a conscious consecration to God's Will.



* 48. Coadjutor

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:48
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, who is my second-best /coadjutor/ in my spiritual life? The first /coadjutor/ is undoubtedly the Guru.

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, the second best /helper/ without fail is the second personal pronoun.



* 49. Cogitate

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:49
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, I cogitate and cogitate, yet my problems are not being solved. Please tell me the reason.

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, you /think/ hard and /reflect/ sincerely, yet your problems don't go away. Such being the case, I advise you to wait and see. God's Grace will, before long, descend on your devoted head and aspiring heart.



* 50. Cognomen

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:50
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, I have been thinking of asking you a most significant, yet silly question. Please tell me, what is God's /cognomen/?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, God's /surname/ is Compassion, His middle name is Justice. When His Justice fails, His Compassion works. When His Compassion fails, His Justice works. He uses His Justice first to deal with a non-aspirant and then, if necessity demands, He uses His Compassion. He uses His Compassion first to deal with an aspirant and then, if necessity demands, He uses His Justice.



* 51. Compunction

  :PROPERTIES:

  :cite-key: TBMC:51
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, please tell me frankly if your heart is full of /compunction/ when you see that some disciple of yours has done something wrong, serious and dangerous?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, whenever any disciple of mine does something unthinkably wrong I do not show him /pity/. What I usually do in that case is identify myself with him with my utmost concern and give him life-saving divine warnings so that he does not repeat his fatal misdeeds.



* 52. Concomitant

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:52
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, I want to be admired by all, especially by my friends. Is it possible for me to be admired by all without any /concomitant/ responsibility to them?

/Chinmoy:/

Yes, Madal, it is possible. But if you do not shoulder the /accompanying/ responsibility, which is your devoted concern for others, then your joy can never be complete and perfect.



* 53. Congenital

  :cite-key: TBMC:53
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, do you have any /congenital/ doubters in your spiritual family?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, thank God, I do not have any disciple who is a /born/ doubter. Today my disciples may have a wee doubt, tomorrow they will have none, and the day after tomorrow what they will have is faith, implicit faith, infinite faith.



* 54. Conjecture

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: TBMC:54
  :END:


/Madal:/

Chinmoy, do you often make a decision on the basis of /conjecture/?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, no, I do not make a decision based on my /opinion/ or on others' opinion. I make a decision, commanded and guided by God's Will.



* 55. Consternation

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse

/Madal:/

Chinmoy, do you agree with me when I say that there is not even one newspaper which does not exploit facts and also create unnecessary /consternation/ in the public mind?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, I fully agree with you. I wish you would write to all the editors of the newspapers and urge them not to create /terror/ in our existence.

/Madal:/

Chinmoy, my /contemporaries/ do not like me. What shall I do with my life?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, don't worry, if /people of your own age/ do not like you, then mix with children. If children also don't like you, then try to mix only with sincere seekers who are God's chosen children. They will not only like you but love you.

/Madal:/

Chinmoy, I have heard that hippies in America speak of everyone and everything with great /contumely/. Is it true?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, I do not really know. Even if they speak of everyone and everything with /great contempt and scorn/, and even if they have other undivine qualities, God's boundless Compassion will forgive them and lead them to the right path eventually.



* 58. Convivial

/Madal:/

Chinmoy, is it necessary for a truly spiritual person to be /convivial/?

/Chinmoy:/

Yes, Madal, it really is necessary for a truly spiritual man to be /sociable/, otherwise he will not be able to offer his inner wealth most satisfactorily to mankind.



* 59. Convolution

/Madal:/

Chinmoy, I know that the life of an insincere and unaspiring man is full of pointless and meaningless /convolutions/. Please tell me about the life of a sincere and aspiring man.

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, the life of a sincere and aspiring man is freed from these /turns and windings/. He walks along the sunlit path and reaches unmistakably the supreme Goal.

Chinmoy, some of the Indian spiritual masters are /corpulent/. Why are they like that?

Madal, I cannot possibly answer that question. They are too /fat/; perhaps they eat too much. God alone knows how sincerely and devotedly I am trying not to be in their group.

Chinmoy, I feel that God is always sad because human beings are not living a divine life. What can we do to brighten up his /countenance/?

Chinmoy, is there any /covert/ intention in God's Plan why all human beings without exception are imperfect?

Madal, there is no /secret/ intention on His part. We human beings do not continuously and consciously try to perfect our outer nature. That is why we remain so imperfect.

Chinmoy, do you have any disciple who is /depraved/?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, you must know that God is not so unkind to me. He has not given me and will never give me, anyone who is /incorrigibly/ evil. To be sure, God has not created anybody whose nature cannot be changed and who cannot be made into a perfect instrument of His manifestation on earth.

Chinmoy, very often humanity on the whole greets the spiritual masters with /derision/. Why?

/Chinmoy:/

O, Madal, I think humanity greets only the self-styled and unrealised spiritual masters with /laughter and mockery/ and not the genuine spiritual masters. Again I must say that at times even the good and true spiritual masters are greeted with foul mockery and laughter. In such cases, I must say that humanity is not ready to accept their divine light. I feel extremely sorry both for the unaspiring humanity and for the self-giving spiritual masters.

Chinmoy, are you one of the spiritual masters who always act like a /despot/?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, this question is too difficult for me to answer. My disciples are truly qualified to answer this question on my behalf. In secret they will tell you, "Yes, Sri Chinmoy is a /dictator/ of the first water." In public they will tell you, "No, never; our Guru is all love and all compassion!"

Chinmoy, sometimes I notice that you tell things in a /discursive/ manner. Why do you do that?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, I deeply appreciate your observation and accusation. It is absolutely true that at times /I do not stick to the point/, but God is so kind and forgiving to me that He has given me quite a few disciples who love me in spite of my teeming incapacities in this field.

Chinmoy, no doubt, you are a musician. Unfortunately I cannot call you a good musician, for you have never sung a song or played a piece of music without making some serious error. Anyway, I want to ask you if /dissonance/ bothers you?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, the pure and clear sincerity within me shakes hands with your proud assessment of the musician in me. I like and don't like /discord and unharmonious/ effects in music. I like it because the child in me still likes restlessness and excitement. I don’t like it because the old, traditional, austere Indian Yogi in me finds it difficult to appreciate anything that creates restlessness and excitement.

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, I agree with you to some extent. If in any matter my opinion is totally wrong, certainly anyone can /easily lead/ me to change my wrong opinion. But if I am not wrong, I shall not change my opinion just to please someone who at that time is completely wrong.

Chinmoy, during your group meditation at times I see some of your close disciples simply become /ecstatic/. Do they not become insane then?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, absurd. How can they lose their brains when God's Light and Delight enter into their beings like a torrential rain. You must know that in order to appreciate others' Light and /Delight/ one has to be at least spiritual.

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, just mix with children. Just spend a few hours in the playground, you are bound to be lively and you will be /bubbling/ with energy once again. You can also chant daily. That will help you much in becoming lively.

Chinmoy, how many disciples do you have who have the /effrontery/ to argue with you?

Chinmoy, I must admit that you are a spiritual lion. Tell me one thing, what is the thing that you are doing wrong which /enervates/ you after you have had a long meditation?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, nothing actually /weakens/ me before, during or after a long meditation. To me, meditation is all energy and all life. It is the wild resistance from the unlit vital of some of my disciples, and the opposition of the unaspiring earth consciousness that at times weaken me, my human body, and the human in me when I bring down light into their obscure, unaspiring and resisting natures.

Chinmoy, when you /explicate/ a most difficult spiritual idea or concept, do your disciples offer you their deepest gratitude, or do they just remain silent taking everything for granted, since they are, after all, your children?

/Chinmoy:/

Dear Madal, even their silence itself is a sign of inner gratitude. But I wish to tell you that when I /explain and unfold/ something difficult to them, at that time, I do not need, I do not even expect gratitude from them. What I expect from them is the application of my advice in their outer life.

Madal, it is true that it is ridiculously /sad and painful/ on the part of the spiritual Masters when they think of their ex-disciples. One thing you do not know, and perhaps you will never know, is that the souls of the so-called ex-disciples do not and cannot leave the Master so easily, and that is why the sincere concern and compassion of the masters extends to their ex-disciples.

No, Madal, I don't. Women are not /over-emotional/. They are not /over-sentimental/. To me a women is insecurity incarnate, and a man is impurity incarnate.

Chinmoy, I shall be extremely happy if you can learn how to play on the flute. Your harmonium does not have /mellifluous/ tones at all.

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, I don't disagree with you. True, my harmonium does not offer any /sweetly flowing/ tones, but it has been my most faithful friend. I don't want to have a new friend at this old age. My childhood friend is dearer than the dearest and sweeter than the sweetest.

Chinmoy, do you concur with me when I say that all religions are /moribund/?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, I do not agree with you. Religions and the leaders of all religions are quite alive. It is our human faith in religion that is /dying/, and we shall before long see the result of this deplorable state. But Yoga will come to the rescue of all people, whether they have faith in religion or not. Yoga will show them a most significant road that will lead them directly to God-Realisation even if they do not care for any specific religion or even for religion itself at all.

Chinmoy, do you ever use an /objurgatory/ voice when you deal with your spiritual children?

/Chinmoy:/

Yes, Madal, I do. To tell you the truth, my spiritual children are so fond of me that they don't mind my /rebuking/ voice and my imperious nature. I am trying hard to be more loving and more sympathetic. I am most anxiously waiting for God to say, "Amen".

Madal, it is a /shameful/ situation only when one is deceitful, and not when he is wanting in peace. Peace is a divine wealth. We get it when we inwardly cry for it.

Chinmoy, it is said that God is extremely fond of children. To me, all children are but /obstreperous/, hence I literally hate them. Do you care for children?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, I do care for children. I like them, I love them, I adore them. You hate /unruly/ children, and my budding disciples hate their unruly thoughts. So you and my disciples can be in the same boat sailing towards the destination -- nowhere.

Chinmoy, in your inner life you are most generous. I am glad that you are not /parsimonious/ in your outer life either.

Chinmoy, every day, being very busy, I meditate for fifteen minutes in a rather /perfunctory/ manner. I wonder if my soul forgives me?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, your soul will forgive you, but a day will come when you will not be able to forgive yourself. If you meditate in a /mechanical and soulless/ way, your God-Realisation will always remain a far cry.

Madal, unfortunately God has not blessed me with an intellectual mind. I really find it most difficult to appreciate any /controversy/ or mental debate. Simplicity satisfies my heart.

Yes, Madal, a Yogi can do that. He can /take any form/ he wants to. But you have to know that only a third class Yogi enjoys assuming the form of an animal, whereas a real Yogi, the first class Yogi, enjoys the divine life in a human body.

Chinmoy, very often a seeker's mind is /regressive/, in spite of his heart being progressive. Is the seeker responsible for that?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, to some extent he is. His mind is /going backwards/ because consciously or unconsciously he is cherishing doubt and jealousy. His heart is going forwards because consciously he is aspiring to increase divine love and divine dedication in his nature.

/Madal:/

Chinmoy, if God is omnipresent how it is that His Love is not /ubiquitous/?

/Chinmoy:/

My God is everywhere, His Love is everywhere, but unfortunately we deny His Presence and suspect His Love.

/Madal:/

Chinmoy, do you have any disciple whose /unctuous/ manners bother you?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, to my deepest sorrow, I have more than one. The /oily and flattering/ manners of those particular disciples torture my heart, but I must say that they are improving. Simplicity, sincerity and spontaneity are slowly invading them!

/Madal:/

Chinmoy, do you get joy when you /upbraid/ your disciples?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, I don't get any joy whatsoever when I /scold/ my disciples. I scold them because their inner divinity commands me to do so for their perfection.

Chinmoy, does your spirituality demand /urbane/ manners?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, certainly, my spirituality demands /courteous and civil/ manners.

/Madal:/

Chinmoy, do you think that it is possible, even among the sincere seekers, there are some men who are nothing but /uxorious/?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, it is not only possible, but a glaring reality, that there are seekers on earth who are foolishly and /excessively devoted to their wives/.

/Madal:/

Chinmoy, how can I be free totally from the /vagaries/ of my mind?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, you can be totally free from the /whims/ of your mind, if you can constantly feel that you are the child of your heart and that your heart is the child of love-light.

/Madal:/

Chinmoy, like some illustrious philosophers, do you not think the earth is a /vapid/ shore?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, I do not agree with those great philosophers. If you look at the world with your own eyes and in your own way, then the world is undoubtedly an /empty/ shore But if you look at the world with God's Eyes and in God's Way, then in no time you will come to realise that the ever-fulfilling world is the Reality of the ever-growing Divinity.

/Madal:/

Chinmoy, my uncle always stays home and /vegetates/. Is there anything that I can do for the poor man?

/Chinmoy:/

Yes, Madal, you can. After your daily prayers and meditation you should go and talk to your uncle for ten minutes at least. He will get much inspiration from you and then he will give up /leading an unthinking and useless life/.

Chinmoy, is there anything that is not /venial/?

Madal, self-indulgence is not /pardonable/.

/Madal:/

Chinmoy, what is the difference between /veracity/ and mendacity?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, the difference between /truth/ and falsehood is very simple. Truth is something that you really are. Falsehood is something that you never are.

Chinmoy, what is totally /verboten/ in your philosophy?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, in my philosophy self-doubt is totally /forbidden/.

/Madal:/

Chinmoy, in /verity/, human life is a frustration-boat heading towards destruction-rock.

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, in /truth/, human life is God's Dream-boat sailing towards the Golden Shore of Perfection.

/Madal:/

Chinmoy, since I started practicing yoga, the /vicissitudes/ in my outer life have taken a rather drastic form.

/Chinmoy:/

But, Madal, I must also add that the /changes/ in your inner life are most fulfilling.



* 197. Vindictive

/Madal:/

Chinmoy, can a spiritual master tolerate a disciple who is extremely /vindictive/ in his outer life?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, if a spiritual master has consciously accepted a /mean and spiteful/ disciple, then he has the capacity to tolerate that particular disciple. Moreover the master has the capacity to transform the disciple's nature.

/Madal:/

Chinmoy, I have a friend whose son is /vociferous/ in his absurd statements with regard to the spiritual life. Please tell me, Chinmoy, if my poor friend can do something to change his son's attitude?

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, if your friend's son is excessively /loud and emphatic/ in his silly statements as regards the spiritual life, then tell your friend that he has to be either more compassionate or more forceful in dealing with his son. One of the two medicines will surely bring peace to your friend.

/Madal:/

Chinmoy, am I right in thinking that spirituality means that one has to totally give up the /voluptuous/ life?

/Chinmoy:/

No, spirituality means the transformation of the /sensual, pleasure-loving and pleasure-giving/ life into purity's flood.

Chinmoy, it seems to me that sometimes you enjoy /wry/ humour.

/Chinmoy:/

Madal, you are perfectly right. It is my sense of /indirect/ humour that has still kept my sanity.
