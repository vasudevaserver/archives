#+BEGIN_VERSE

My Lord, kidnap my heart, I humbly pray.
Alas, mine is the life of a ruthless knave.
I must die; no one must mourn and toll the knell.
Without Thy Light my goal an error grave.

Eyeless desires and I together live.
The human souls frown at my moping mind.
My famished heart pines for Thy Bounty-height.
Awaken my Will, my Lord, Thy Love to bind.

My heart shall be as pure as Aurora's tears.
My wild vital must change its volcano-choice.
To hound my golden thoughts my vital horse
In vain endeavours; in me His Ecstasy-Voice.

I try, I cry, I sigh, but all in vain.
O Lord of my bleeding heart, I need the Eye
That sees the lives of the Present, Future, Past.
O doubt, aside you stay from my mission's sky!

Her sleepless pangs in me now breathe.
For her my freedom vast, my birth.

    Sole hope of the earth are you;
Ere long your mystic journey start!

I am Thy servant of-servants, humble, low,
Truly I care not who Thou art, O Lord!
Thy Grace I invoke, only Thy Grace sublime
In Thee alone I find my bosom's cord.

My mind craves not for fame, O Thou Unknown,
Nor for Thy boundless Power, Knowledge-Sun.
My Lord, my first and last desire serene --
Make me Thy Vision's golden deathless son.

My nature old in me creates

A day shall come, I know it well,

My days and nights are fast asleep,
Long lost am I in their bosoms wide.
The gloom and pangs of unknown caverns

No mighty Soul to soothe my heart;
My sinking breath without a friend.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

A tortuous stream our only fate,
A sluggish evolution's flow
We feel from morn to eve of our life.
Who says the One in us shall grow?

Covered we are with Nothingness;
The ignorance breathes deep in our heart.
No hope of dawn in our Stupor-breast;
Before our heart-beat gleams death-dart.

We dwell upon the barren surface;
Alas, we never go within.
The Supreme's Bliss remains unknown;
Around us sports a dreadful din.

I alter now the course
Of my bosom's goalless rill.

Bursts forth within; the Play is begun.

To feed the human souls with ceaseless might

No death can bind my climbing faith divine;

Undying desires of man

Thus does he fail to dwell
    In boundless Immortality, his End.
