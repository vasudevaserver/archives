7 January 1998

Twenty-first Century, the New Millennium!

No more the old sorrows and joys-compendium.

God's Heart, God's Eye, a new hope and a new promise!

O run and dive and fly -- Bliss, Infinity's Bliss!

The world shall cheer the road with a God-surrender-song.

Creator's Silence-Hearts, creation's sound-lives throng.
