Twenty-First Century, the New Millennium!
No more the old sorrows and joys-compendium.
God's Heart, God's Eye, a new hope and a new promise!
O run and dive and fly-Bliss, Infinity's Bliss!
The world shall cheer the road with a God-surrender-song.
Creator's Silence-Hearts, creation's sound-lives throng.

And ever-fulfilling oneness.

The God-love and God-devotion-boats
Are sailing slowly and steadily
Towards the Destination.
The God-surrender-boat
Is still fast asleep.
But in the New Millennium
These three boats
Will sail unimaginably fast
Towards the Golden Shore
For the transformation of human life,
The perfection of the human heart
And the manifestation of
God's Light and Delight
In every corner of the globe.
