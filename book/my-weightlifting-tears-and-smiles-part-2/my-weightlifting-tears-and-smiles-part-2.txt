* Bringing Light Into Inconscience

What I do in lifting heavy weights is something really significant on the physical plane -- bringing down light into inconscience. Metal is nothing but inconscience, and to bring down light into matter is a most difficult task. For light to enter into inconscience is a supreme achievement for humanity, because it is inconscience which always fights against light.

Bill Pearl joined us for our concert in San Jose, and he introduced the video of my weightlifting after the concert. While we were in California, he took measurements of my arms, chest and legs. He was appreciating the strength of my chest and leg muscles. He said my left calf is practically an inch larger than my right calf. He said all kinds of very nice things about me.

On the video when he saw me lift 1,500 pounds in the calf raise, he couldn’t believe it. He was screaming, “He is lifting, he is lifting!” When I was lifting the boat, he was so moved. Then he asked Nirvik if Nirvik would lift 500 pounds, but Nirvik said no.

This morning it was only a matter of seconds for me to lift the elephant, but how long the preparation took! I needed a half hour to warm up at home and then another half hour at the court. So it took one hour of preparation for a 10-second lift.

Before the lift, Cahit, our champion-runner-friend, was worrying about whether I had a weightlifting belt. So I showed him that I was wearing it. Then I showed off for him. I did 1,000 pounds on my calf raise machine ten times easily. Then I did 1,200 pounds 12 times. He was so amazed; he didn’t dare to try.

Of all the pictures related to my weightlifting, the one where Kanu is looking at the calf has given me the most joy. Both of them are showing such affection to each other. That was the time the boys took a picture of the calf next to my 350-pound dumbbell to show how heavy the weight was.

The T-shirt that I gave Pulak this morning says, “I may not be smart, but I can lift heavy things.” In Hawaii, one of the saleswomen in a weightlifting store was wearing it. I asked her if I could buy one like that, and she said, “Yes, but we only have extra large.”

I said, “I need a large. Extra large will be too big for me.”

She said, “No, no, you take the extra large. You are on your way.”

Another store had only small and medium T-shirts. When I asked for a large, the lady said, “We only have small and medium, but a medium will fit you.”

So each store had its own story to tell. One said I am on my way to extra large,and the other said I am definitely a medium.

When I was in Hawaii, Savyasachi and I went into a weightlifting store called the Hawaiian Sports Shoppe. There were posters on the wall of Lee Haney and Tom Platz. I showed the salesman the article about me in Iron Man magazine. He was so excited that he called the owner and the manager, and they told all the customers about me.

The owner was a young man and the manager was an old man. The owner has been doing weightlifting for 10 years and the manager for 20 years, and they could not believe what I had done in such a short time. Both of them looked at me with such love and respect. They were so excited when I told them I could lift 600 pounds with one arm. They said that they had read the /Iron Man/ article twice and also they had read about me in /Flex/ and other magazines.

Then they wanted to give me a T-shirt and hat free. They asked me what colour I wanted and I told them blue. So the T-shirt they gave me was my favourite colour.

Then they asked me for an autographed poster or a picture of me that they could put up in the store. When I went back another time to show them some pictures, they chose my 503-pound lift. They were most impressed with how high I had lifted it off the bar. They immediately framed the picture and put it up with the posters of Lee Haney and Tom Platz. They were also impressed with the picture of me lifting the elephant, but they said that the picture of me lifting the weight was better for them since they are a weightlifting store.

I went into another weightlifting store in Hawaii to buy a dumbbell, but the owner said they did not sell single dumbbells. He said that in Hawaii dumbbells have to be bought by the pair. But why did I need two?

I showed him the article about me in /Iron Man/ magazine. When he read about my calf raise lifts, he felt my quadriceps and asked me, “What are they made of?”

He xeroxed the article in /Iron Man/ and read every line very carefully. He didn’t just glance over it. He was so happy to meet me, and we talked for a long time. He told me that two days ago he had tried to lift 250 pounds. He weighs 251 pounds. When I said, “I am 160 pounds,” he just looked at me. He was such a nice boy.

Finally he said, “Now, whatever you want, you can have. You don’t have to buy dumbbells by pairs.” So I got three individual dumbbells: 35, 50 and 60 pounds.

He also wanted a picture of me, and when I went back, he chose the 503-pound lift and immediately put it up on the wall. So both stores have that picture. When I went to the Hawaiian Sports Shoppe, I was trying to buy a 75-pound dumbbell and also a 15-pound dumbbell. The man said, “We always sell by the pair, but I will have to sell you a single one. How can I sell you this if you don’t want two?”

I said, “I don’t need two. I am here only for one week.”

The previous time I was in Hawaii, everything was sold in pairs also.

In one of the weightlifting stores they were reading each and every line of Vidagdha’s article. When they saw Lee Haney’s comment about me, they were so moved. One of them said to me, “You must be happy that Lee Haney has again become Mr. Olympia.”

I asked, “When?”

He said, “The day before yesterday, on the 13th of October. It was in Columbus, Ohio. I watched it on television. You didn’t see it?”

I said, “He is my friend. He encourages me like anything.”

He said, “But you didn’t know about it? You don’t read the magazines?”

I said, “I read them and my students read them, but I didn’t know.”

Then he went to his room and brought me the previous issue of one of the magazines, which announced the contest. He was 100 per cent right.

Afterwards, I sent Lee Haney a telegram congratulating him. Mandabhi spoke to him after he received it and said he was very, very moved.

Only the previous day, they had put my picture up in a store next to Lee Haney’s picture. He will be in Hawaii on the 25th of October to give away prizes at a weightlifting contest.

At one of the weightlifting stores there was a big 600-pound dumbbell. I asked the owner, “Why do you keep a 600-pound dumbbell here?”

He explained about a contest he was holding. He said it started a few months ago when he declared that whoever could lift up a 300-pound dumbbell would get it free. About three months ago somebody accepted the challenge and lifted it a little with two hands.

Then he put a 400-pound dumbbell on display. He thought the same fellow would come back, but somebody else came. The man struggled and finally lifted it up.

After that he put out a 500-pound dumbbell. Just yesterday somebody from California who had come to enter the weightlifting competition lifted up the 500-pound dumbbell, so now he had put out a 600-pound one.

The people in the store begged me to try to lift the 600-pound dumbbell. “You try,” the owner said.

I said, “I am trying 600 over my head, but I do not want to try lifting this from the ground with two hands.” I didn’t want to be embarrassed.

So Savyasachi tried. When Savyasachi tried it, it didn’t move to this side or that side. The man said, “No way for him!”

Once I went to Long Island and saw a dumbbell that weighed only 110 pounds. They said, “We will give this to you free if you can lift it.” I could easily have lifted it off the ground, but I didn’t do it. I just bought a chair that folds on both sides and the pulley that I use.

That weight was only 110 pounds. But in Hawaii, the previous day, somebody came and took away 500 pounds, and now they had 600 pounds out. You go to the weightlifting stores and have such fun!

This month at least four times I have been “blessed” by my sister. She didn’t want me to do this kind of lifting. She felt my “imaginative” lifts were beneath my dignity. Two weeks ago my brother said he felt sorry about the way she was scolding and insulting me. But the main reason she was scolding and insulting me is that she is worried I will get hurt. When she hears about the heavy weight, she thinks, “O God, one day he will get hurt!”

You heard last night’s story told by Sol. Sol’s experience was very good. He said that the man who criticized my lifting of the first plane was inside the second plane that I lifted.

The pumpkins that I lifted today were very heavy, plus I didn’t have any warm-up. It really killed me! Normally, first I warm up at home, and then I take warm-up exercises for at least half an hour at the tennis court as well. But today, because of the rain, I could not warm up.

The first time I tried lifting the pumpkins, I could not do it. I said, “Today will be my Waterloo experience!”

But then on my second try I lifted them up. The third time, I lifted the boys also. Then the newspaper photographer begged me to do it a fourth time. While he was taking pictures the previous time, our boys had asked him to move. So I did it again for the reporter, and I held it up for a longer time than before so the photographer could take pictures. He took three or four. In one I was smiling even. I had turned to the people who were watching and was smiling.

* Help In Reaching My Goal

  :END:


This morning I reached my ultimate goal -- 705 pounds. I have done it with my Beloved Supreme’s infinite Grace. Just before I started lifting, my prayer was:

My Lord Supreme,
My Beloved Supreme,
Your infinite Compassion decides
The choice hour for me.
Your infinite Compassion also transforms
My human greed
Into Your divine Need.

When human greed becomes His divine Need, then one can be of real inspiration and true service to mankind. So this was my prayer, and a few minutes after it was offered, I was able to lift 705 pounds.

When I lift, there is always some divine Grace in the form of gods, goddesses or relatives and friends who come to inspire me. They are of real help. Today it was my dearer-than-the-dearest Mother Kali who came. Inside me she is always visible, but today I saw her very vividly on the wall, where the window is. She had a larger-than-the-largest garland around her neck. I saw it when I was lifting. On my third attempt she was looking at me so powerfully and compassionately. On my fourth attempt I clearly saw her placing her feet on the metal plates and the bar. Then I saw in my intuitive world that I was going to lift it. On that attempt, I was looking only at her face. My concentration was so powerful at that time, I didn’t see the garland, and I was wondering where it went. Then, in my highest point of concentration, I saw that the garland was on my neck. Then I made the attempt and I was successful. She had garlanded me before I had actually made the lift. Then I lifted it again on my fifth attempt. After that she was playing with the garland she had placed on me.

Now I can cut jokes. About a month ago some of the disciples didn’t have faith that I would be able to lift 700 pounds. I said I would put them into garbage bags. So many disciples I put in garbage bags! Today I can open up the garbage bags and release them.

This morning when I was attempting to lift 800 pounds with one arm, Mother Kali was right in front of me, full of compassion and power. When I was about to make my fourth attempt, Mother Kali said to me, “My son, it is already done.” Then I did lift 800 pounds.

So for both 700 and 800 pounds, all credit goes to my dearest Mother Kali.

Early this morning while I was taking exercise, Mother Kali and the soul of my physical mother were there. The soul of Nivedita was also there for at least 45 minutes.

Nivedita’s soul is most beautiful, most beautiful. So lovingly she was watching me while I was taking various exercises. She was moving around and telling me, “My Lord, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it!” And she was absolutely right, absolutely right! This morning I lifted up 1,007 ľ pounds. As soon as I completed the lift she offered me a most beautiful flower, and while offering the flower she said, “Congratulations, my Lord, and my eternal gratitude.”

These visions are more real to me than my own name, Chinmoy. Chinmoy is just a fleeting name, an earthly name. But my God-realisation-experiences, visions and illuminations, which come from my Beloved Supreme’s infinite Compassion, are infallible and immortal.

The day after we inaugurated the meditation at the British Parliament, we went to visit Jim Smith, the Registrar of Records for the British Amateur Weight Lifters’ Association. He lives about an hour and a half from London on a farm. There he has a flock of sheep and some cows. One of the rams was very bad-tempered, so he had to grab it by the horns. He used the word “nasty” when talking about the ram.

He also has six or seven ducks which he wanted to show me. I said, “Oh, this reminds me of my Chittagong days. Every week there I used to eat duck and duck eggs.”

He couldn’t believe it. He never eats duck, but he eats chicken and chicken eggs, which I never ate. He said he also eats fish. I said, “I used to eat fish every day. And until the age of 11 or 12, I used to eat turtle and duck.”

When I first arrived, Jim Smith’s wife, Brenda, didn’t want to shake hands with me. She said her hands were dirty because she had been baking. Finally she said, “Do you mind if I shake hands with my left hand?”

She is very simple, with a very good heart. She had all kinds of refreshments, plus four or five kinds of tea. Since I don’t drink tea, I asked for hot chocolate, and she was miserable that she didn’t have it. So I had orange juice. After I drank a second orange juice, I put the glass on the floor. Then, while I was talking I accidentally kicked the glass. I had forgotten that it was there, but fortunately I had already drunk the juice. I apologised like anything, but Brenda said, “Oh never mind, never mind. There is nothing inside.”

Before we left, Brenda gave gifts to everyone -- a tie or a muffler made from their own sheep’s wool. She gave me a beautiful brown and white sheepskin, which she said I should stand on while I do my lifting.

Jim Smith was so surprised to see the pictures of my elephant lift. When he saw the truck and the plane, he put his hands on his head. He was so happy when he saw the 800-pound one-arm lift. I asked him, “Is it all right?”

He saw very clearly that I was lifting the weight off the power rack. Then he said, “I am sure you have done 1,000 pounds by now!”

We were still hiding the 1,000-pound picture, but then we showed it to him. When he saw it, he used the term “balmy.” He looked at it for a few seconds, then went running to the gym to show it to his students.

When he came back, he gave me a gold medal that he had had made when he heard I was definitely coming. He showed it to me and then put it around my neck. It says, “Sri Chinmoy -- 5x bwt,” which means “five times body weight.” Then it says, “Right arm, November 1986.” Under that it says, “British Amateur Weight Lifters’ Association.” Then in Latin on a kind of crest or shield is written, “Faith moves mountains.” Jim apologised that the medal was already out of date, because he didn’t know before that I had already lifted more than six times my body weight. But he said he had definitely been expecting me to do it.

Jim expects one of his students to be in the Olympics in 1992. He is doing very well in weightlifting. At one point, this boy came up to me with the picture of my 1,600-pound calf raise. He was telling me that he has been practising for four or five years but he cannot lift more than 300 or 400 pounds. He wanted to know how I can do 1,600. He is only about 18 years old, and quite short, but very strong.

Jim Smith is dead against my using dumbbells. He said that using a dumbbell with one hand is not good, whereas barbells give better protection. You can see if anything is going to happen.

He was giving a demonstration with a 60 or 70-pound barbell. Then he wanted his best friend Agraha to come and join him. Agraha, poor fellow, was absolutely miserable. First Jim Smith requested him; then it became almost a command. So Agraha went to try.

First Jim Smith told him, “Now lift up the barbell to your knees.”

So Agraha lifted it up to his knees.

Then Jim Smith said, “Don’t look at me. Only look at my shoulders. Now you have to lift it to your shoulders!” The command was coming absolutely from the commander-in-chief. So Agraha lifted it up to his shoulders. Afterwards, his face was totally pale.

Then Jim Smith practically shouted at him, “Now you have to lift it over your head!” It was such a powerful command that Agraha did lift it over his head. They are such good friends!

I have never seen any Briton with such a kind, sympathetic oneness-heart. I used to always say that the British are measured; each word they say is measured. But for Jim Smith there is no measurement. It is all immeasurable -- a spontaneous flow right from the beginning.

Jim Smith’s concern for me and his constant encouragement are really something. Jim Smith and Bill Pearl -- one from America and one from England -- have offered me constant, constant encouragement and inspiration.

When I told Jim that I am now aiming at 1,300, he said, “No, no, not 1,300 -- 1,500! 1,300 is not necessary. Now that you have gone beyond what the mind can comprehend in your weightlifting, you can do what the mind can’t even imagine!”

Usually, when I get up I take a 10-minute shower, but this time I took a 20-minute shower to make sure I didn’t fall asleep while exercising.

I did each exercise so many times! First I lifted 10 pounds 50 times, then I lifted 20, 30 and 40 pounds. From 40 pounds I jumped up to 2,000.

Last night a few boys were over at my house for Sahishnu’s birthday. Everybody was predicting when I would lift 2,000 pounds. They all said I would do it today. Dhanu and Achyuta were the only ones who didn’t make any predictions.

Some were saying that I would do it at 1:30 in the morning. I told them that I would not try before 4:30 because I was so tired and exhausted, but still they thought I would try right away.

Some predicted times that were only 10 minutes after Unmilan and others finished building the new power rack.

Sahishnu’s prediction was the closest. He said I would lift 2,000 pounds at 7:37 a.m.

This morning at 4:30, I started doing my usual endless weightlifting exercises. Then, at around a quarter to seven, I started attempting to lift 2,039. It was over 500 pounds heavier than my previous best lift, 3 days ago. My fifth attempt was my best performance. After my fifth attempt, I looked at the time and saw it was 7:40. So Sahishnu’s prediction was the best.

Ketan was the farthest away. He said I would do it at 9:00.

I always give a very nice prayer before I lift, either silently or out loud. Today in my mind I was praying that either in the near or distant future I would lift the 2,000 pounds. But the phrase “in the near or distant future” was not coming out. I could not add that phrase to my prayer because God knew that it wouldn’t be in the near or distant future but in the immediate future.

When I lifted 1,515 pounds a few days ago and also today when I lifted 2,039 pounds, only my Mother Kali was there -- nobody else. She did everything to help me. She came with such power and such beauty and stood on the metal plates with one foot on one side and the other foot on the other side. Then she lifted the weights up on the inner plane even before I actually started my lift. Then, just before I began my actual lift, she told me, “My child, you have done it!” Then she got off the weight.

When she stands on the weight, which is so high, the ceiling disappears. At that time you don’t even see the ceiling. The inner plane where the gods and goddesses appear is far beyond the physical plane, so the physical surroundings don’t interfere at all.

If I see the video, I will be able to see Mother Kali. She has become part and parcel of the video because her consciousness in the room was so powerful. With the third eye one can see it. The original video has the fragrance of her consciousness. I do not know if she will appear on copies.

2,000 pounds feels so difficult compared to 1,500. But extra strength comes from within. This extra strength you can see in my screaming. For today’s 2,000-pound lift, the noise that I made you can’t imagine! It is so frightening!

I concentrate on each weight before I lift it. At the same time, I don’t think of it. When I look at the weights, believe me, there is nobody more frightened than I am. I say, “This is the weight I am going to lift!” But then more inner strength comes.

Two video cameras can prove that I did my 2,000-pound one-arm lift. On my second attempt I was successful, and my third and fourth lifts were progressively better. But the fifth one was the best.

On my fifth lift my tongue was out of my mouth! If Ranjana had taken pictures from the other side, then my tongue could have been seen. I became like Mother Kali. On the video you can hear what kind of scream I gave.

After I did my 2,000-pound one-arm lift, I was so happy! I phoned up Bill Pearl right away. I was so excited and he was so excited. He knew I was trying to do 2,000, but he thought it would take 10 to 15 days because Unmilan had not yet fixed the power rack. When I told him what time I did the lifts, he said that he had been saying my name 100 times at that very hour, while I was lifting.

Bill Pearl says I am not threatening anybody in the weightlifting world now because I have passed that stage. He says I have come to the “unbelievable” stage.

This morning, when I was lifting the cow, the weight that they gave was totally wrong. When I first tried to lift it, I said, “This will be my first embarrassment.” Then I killed myself and did it!

I wanted to have Samarpana on the platform while I was lifting the cow, but the cow was so heavy that I changed my mind. I said, “Now if I take Samarpana also, it will be too much for me to lift.”

Already the platform that is on top of my shoulders weighs 460 pounds. It is much more difficult than the one which rests on the ground.

In Chittagong we had a cow named Nandini that was almost the same size as the one I lifted today. We had anothercow named Surabhi. Surabhi was quite thin and Nandini was quite heavy.

Of all the animals, the cow received the most from me spiritually when I lifted it up. Then came the bull. The donkey was the worst. The deer received a little. One horse received a lot. The lamb also received.

Both the elephants received so much. The big one, Jack, received a lot. Before the lift, I garlanded it and said, “You are my friend, my heart’s friend, my soul’s friend, my life’s friend.”

Karen, the little elephant, also received, but Jack’s soul is more mature, much more advanced. Jack will have a human incarnation, whereas Karen will take a few more animal incarnations.

Now the owner has become my greatest admirer. He has posted so many pictures of my weightlifting. Yesterday he predicted I will do 2,000 pounds. He has pictures of my 600 and 800-pound lifts. But when I went to his gym the first time, he would not talk to me.

He was comparing his experience to what happened when I led a meditation at the bodybuilding exhibition in Vancouver. Since it was a new world for me, he thought in front of 2,000 people I would also behave that way. But I didn’t get frightened. I only had to meditate; I didn’t have to say a word.

The father took my side. He said, “What is wrong? If one has capacity in any field, one should show it to the world. If I had that kind of capacity, I would also show the world.”

This morning I saw the jacket Vidagdha gave me that says, “Training for 1 Ton.” When I saw the jacket, I got confidence that I would do 2,000 pounds. I said, “Let me do it today.”

First I did 400, 600, 800 and then 1,000 pounds, and all the time I was wearing her jacket. She will be so happy!

Then I went from 1,000 to 2,000. When I was lifting 2,000, I didn’t dare use the jacket because I knew I had to kill myself and the jacket might be slippery. I was afraid the weight might slip off my shoulders. So I took the jacket off and held it in front of the video camera.

I wanted to put oil on my calves to show off, but there was no oil downstairs. I was so lazy; I didn’t want to go upstairs to get the oil. I found some “body-bath” yellow lotion, but it seems it had no oil in it. As soon as I put it on, it disappeared. If it had had a little oil in it, it would have remained on the skin, but it did not last.

The automatic camera takes away all my joy. Before I lift I am all concentration, but when I have to turn the camera on, all my concentration goes away. The switch is near my left ear.

Dhanu has told me that it will photograph for not more than 12 to 14 seconds, and it takes 6 pictures per second. I said to myself, “Before I lift the weight, perhaps the camera will stop.”

Then I lifted the weight so quickly that the camera was still going after I finished. It sounds like a printing press -- so much noise! It is like a hostile force. How can you concentrate when there is so much noise near you?

Yesterday I went out walking towards Flushing Meadow Park. Lavanya was supposed to catch me at one or two miles, driving in the car. But after two miles Lavanya still did not come. More than two and a half miles I walked! I was miserable because I have not been walking for such a long time.

After one mile I felt sincerely sad that I was not able to practice my one-arm lift. For three or four days I have not lifted because the weights are in Progress-Promise. My Mother Kali immediately appeared to console me.

Mother Kali said that if I want to do heavy weights, I should practise with 700 pounds. But she told me not to exceed 700. She said that if somebody else lifts as heavy a weight as I have, because of my universal oneness, it is actually I who will do it. That person will only have a different name. In this way she consoled me.

Now I am keeping the calf raise machine at my house. I will do those two exercises -- the one-arm lift with 700 pounds and the calf raise -- on alternate days.

The pursuit of peace through the unification of the spirit and body is a process which leads to a better understanding of the essence of mankind. This path is marked by a series of physical and spiritual challenges, and your efforts to push your body to meet or exceed our present limitations, will lead to the challenging of the mind and the spirit.

Your accomplishments show us that the only limitations to the body and the spirit are the limitations which we place upon ourselves. May the love that you hold for mankind extend from the soul through the body into a real and lasting peace.

Sri Chinmoy is no longer a threat to the weightlifting or bodybuilding world, because what he is doing is absolutely unbelievable. He has moved beyond the threatening into the unbelievable. It is beyond human comprehension!

This man is of Godly strength. He is truly amazing. It is humanly impossible for the body’s joints to even budge this kind of weight. Just to support this kind of weight in any way is a miracle. He is not merely lifting a dumbbell. He is trying to lift the attitude of the world. He is showing us that mind can surpass matter, that when we reach for the highestthrough meditation we can succeed in anything.

Any champion must be God’s champion. Sri Chinmoy is a champion of God. He is a very special person, a chosen instrument. I feel I too am chosen. We are the same -- we have been touched by God. He is the best because he is a champion of the heart and soul.

Sri Chinmoy shows that with God there is nothing that is impossible! We can do anything. Sri Chinmoy has proven this in the physical. To stay locked in the spiritual while performing in the body is so hard but so important. That spiritual bond, that link that Sri Chinmoy has, makes all things possible.

Sri Chinmoy is not the normal athlete; he is a special athlete; he is a super superathlete. It is spirituality that separates superathletes from super superathletes. Sri Chinmoy is a super superathlete.

Sri Chinmoy is a very spiritual man. I feel the reason Sri Chinmoy lifted this weight is because of his love of God and belief that through God all things are possible. This man has done the impossible because of faith, wisdom and love of God. Through God we can do anything and He allows us to reach beyond human endeavours. We may feel we can’t go on, but because we find inner faith, we do. The body says “stop,” but the spirit cries “never.” In the warrior’s code there is no stopping.

Give Sri Chinmoy my love. May God continue to shower him with wisdom and faith. I feel God has given Sri Chinmoy strength so many people can realise that God is working through him. God bless him!

Sri Chinmoy has controlled his mind completely. He has conquered his mind totally. It’s like what I would try to do when I would face a wrestling opponent. Sri Chinmoy is using his will to surpass his mind, and he is using his mind to conquer his body. He is putting his thoughts into a higher state to allow him to have a superior capacity.

I tell you, it’s a lot of weight for a little guy, and he’s made a lot of progress. I find it very impressive.
