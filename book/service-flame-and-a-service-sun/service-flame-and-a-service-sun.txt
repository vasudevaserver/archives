Nolini-da's birthday. Four-thirty a.m. I offered my /pranam/ to Nolini-da with some flowers and gave him a poem I had written about him. Around five o'clock in the afternoon he said to me: "I showed your poem to the Mother and She was extremely pleased. By the way, I do not recall if I have given you any sweets."

"Yes, you did," I said. "You gave me some yesterday."

He said: "Yesterday? Come in. Come inside my room." And then he gave me more sweets to eat.

Amrita-da: "Chinmoy, you have done a great service to Nolini by writing a most significant poem.

"Chinmoy, don't think that people are not jealous of Nolini. There are many people in the Ashram who are extremely jealous of him. I pity them. God alone knows when they will realise, let alone reach, his height. But to be sure, you and I are not jealous of Nolini. To me Nolini is not only my elder brother and adviser, but also my eternal friend.

"Chinmoy, how old are you?"

"I am thirty."

"You are not even half my age!"

I said to him: "I enjoyed it a great deal."

Nolini-da said: "I am sure everybody learned much from it."

I was typing in the flower-room when Nolini-da came in.

"This morning I misplaced the file containing my new articles to be added for the new edition of /Banglar Pran/ (the heart of Bengal). Can you look for it?"

Immediately I stood up and rushed into his room. For about half an hour I searched. Finally I found it and gave it to him. With a smile he said to me: "Chinmoy, in this world some people are meant to misplace things and some people are meant to find them."

I asked Amrita-da: "Please tell me in what language the Mother used to speak with Sri Aurobindo?"

He said: "It was always in English."

"And in what language did you speak to Sri Aurobindo?"

"I spoke almost always in English, only at times in Bengali."

"And what about the Mother? What language did you use to speak to Her?"

He said: "Ah, that you know: English, French and what-not."

Nolini-da said to me: "Chinmoy, today you have to do two things for me. First of all you have to find an article I have misplaced. This article is going to be included in the new edition of my book /Narir Katha,/ which the Ashram Press is going to print. I don't remember the name of the article, but I am sure you will be able to find it."

I searched for fifteen minutes and found the article, which was entitled /E Juge Narir Adarsha./

"Now, your second task, Chinmoy, is to try to find the third part of /Matri Bani./ As far as I remember, I wrote it in a grey notebook."

I searched for the notebook in various places, ransacking all the drawer files and bookshelves. But /Matri Bani/ was not to be found.

"Where could it have gone? Where could it have gone?" he exclaimed.

I said to him: "Nolini-da, perhaps you have given it to someone."

He concentrated for two minutes and then said: "No, definitely not! I have not given it to anyone. Look for it. You will find it."

He was right. In five minutes, to his great joy, I did find it.

In the morning, while I was going through the money order coupons, Nolini-da said to me: "This evening I shall read out something very special and significant about my first meeting with Sri Aurobindo and then I shall read out Amrita's autobiography. Sisir has asked me to read out the English version of my meeting with Sri Aurobindo. Sisir feels that if it is read in English, the non-Bengalis can also enjoy it. What do you think of this idea?"

"Your Bengali will always be matchless," I said. "When you read out your articles in Bengali, I get tremendous joy, and when you read out your English articles, I also get tremendous joy. But when you read out others' translations of your Bengali articles, unfortunately I do not get the same joy. I feel something is missing, though I don't know what it is."

He said: "You do know what is missing from my writings which have been translated by others it is my original depth. Anyway, what can I do? This time I shall listen to Sisir's request. Next time I shall definitely read in Bengali

"Today is Republic Day. More than half a century ago we tried to bring about independence in our own way. I shall read out to the Ashramites about our revolutionary activities."

After reading out his article he said: "Now I am going to read out Amrita's story of how he met -- rather, did not meet -- Sri Aurobindo for the first time."

At the end of his reading, Nolini-da's comment: "Indeed, it is an excellent experience, but Amrita stops very abruptly. It is just like eating half a /rasgulla./ I hope later on we will be supplied with a full one."

On the way back to Nolini-da's room, Yogananda-da and I were following him. I was carrying his thermos. He said to me: "I am glad that you brought the thermos today, and I am also glad that Yogananda gave me water to drink the moment I needed it so badly."

X said to Nolini-da in the morning: "Nolini-da, when I was in Calcutta, I heard a rumour that the Mother is extremely sick and has decided to stop giving interviews. They say She won't even give her /darshan/ four times a year. Is it true?"

Nolini-da said: "This is the discovery of some of the Ashramites. Since they don't meditate, how will they get realisation? God had to bless them with a fertile imagination; otherwise, He would have had nothing to give them. I personally wrote to Pathamandir (Calcutta) that they must not pay any attention to such destructive rumours."

I said to Nolini-da: "It seems that you have immortalised Sahana-di in your recent writings."

"Chinmoy, I don't write anything false. She deserves my sincere appreciation."

"Will you please tell me how old you were when you passed your matriculation?"

"Ah, I was only fourteen. My father thought I was too young for the matriculation examination. He wanted me to wait a year or two so that I could pass the examination without any difficulty, but my uncle did not agree with him. My uncle was very wise. He told my father that I would definitely do well in the examination. So I did take the examination. Unlike my uncle, my father did not know how ripe and clever I had already become."

Then he burst into laughter.

I said to Nolini-da: "Yesterday at the playground you told us that you were sharing with us your last life experience. I was so sorry to hear that."

"Tell me, what else do I have to write? Have I not completed my life-story?"

"I don't think so. You have not told us about your sports life in your younger days. I have heard so many stories about you as a great football player."

"I see, I see. But you know that in those days there was neither /Mohan Bagan/ nor /East Bengal/ to inspire us. Anyway, I shall try to write about my football and sports capacity."

"How is Nirmala today? Have the doctors decided when they are going to operate?"

"Arpita-di told me that the doctors have given Nirmala-di a blood transfusion and that she is looking fine. Arpita-di asked me to tell you something else."

"What is it?"

"She says that Nirmala-di is sad that the Mother has to spend fifteen rupees a day to keep her in the hospital."

"Chinmoy, you tell your sister to inform Nirmala-di that she does not have to think of such things. Instead of thinking of the Mother's financial problems, she must think only of her own health problems."

At that point Arita-da happened to pass by and he overheartd the phrase 'health problems'. He said to Nolini-da: "I overheard your conversation. You were telling Chinmoy about Nirmala's health problems. What are you going to do about my ignorance problem?" Then, without saying another word, he just walked away.

Nolini-da burst into laughter and said: "Amrita, our eternal Amrita." Then he said: "Come with me. I have something for you to give to Nirmala." I followed him into his room, where he gave me some of the Mother's /prasad/ for Nirmala-di.

"How did you find my sports activity?"

"Excellent," I said.

Nolini-da said: "I thought you young people wouldn't like old stories about an old man." Then he changed the subject. "I believe Nirmala's operation took place this morning at eight o'clock. Now it is nine-thirty. Do you feel like going to the hospital? Try to bring me an accurate account of her condition."

I went to the hospital and came back with the message that the operation had been quite successful.

Amrita-da happened to be with Nolini-da. Amrita-da said: "That is what the doctors always say. Did you see her? What is your opinion?"

"I saw her sleeping."

Nolini-da said: "I feel now that the operation was quite successful."

"I thought they were like Suresh Chakrabarti's /Hasanter Patra./"

"No, mine are serious. It seems to me that you want to translate them into English."

"I agree with you. Don't send any more."

Ranju-da said: "There are many magazines which are eager to publish your writings. I shall be sending that article to /Amrita./"

"That's a nice idea," Nolini-da said.

A young girl named Minu came to offer her /pranam/ to Nolini-da early in the morning. She was born in Chittagong and I had studied with her for about eight months at the Sri Aurobindo /Vidya Pith/ there. She was quite a brilliant student. She came to Nolini-da for his blessings. After she left, he asked me what her name was. I told him that I had studied with her for a few months in our village and that her name was Minu.

"That cannot be her real name. What is her real name?" he said.

"I don't remember what her real name is."

"You studied with her and you do not know her real name?"

Quite embarrassed, I went out looking for Minu. I found her near Sri Aurobindo's /Samadhi./ I asked her what her real name was and she said it was Amiya.

When I told Nolini-da, he said with a smile: "There is no dearth of /Amiya/ (nectar) at the Ashram, but God alone knows when He will bless us with divine nectar."

In the afternoon, while I was typing in the flower-room, Nolini-da came up to me and said: "Did Rajan tell you that I had enjoyed your article "Ramakrishna, Soul of the East" in the /Amrita Bazar?/"

"Yes, he did."

"It seems that you worked hard on that article. It is always good to work hard when you write something, especially before you send it for publication."

Two American ladies were having an interview with Nolini-da in his room. I had finished my typing and was about to enter his room to return the typewriter. But when I noticed that he was giving an interview, I hesitated and moved away. He called to me: "Why are you not coming in? I have no idea how long our interview will last. Can you take this letter and give it to Amrita?"

While I was putting the typewriter in its proper place and covering it, I overheard part of their conversation. One of the ladies asked Nolini-da: "Sir, please tell me the difference between the Divine Mother and an ordinary human being."

Nolini-da said: "The difference is very simple. We ordinary human beings talk and the Divine Mother acts. We talk and talk. We are empty vessels sounding continuously, while the Mother Divine plays Her role, Her supreme role, in Eternity's Silence."

"Yesterday while we were playing volleyball, the ball went out of the court and dropped near you. You stopped it with your left foot with perfect ease. I was amazed to see it. Your position was right wing. You stopped the ball with your left foot and kicked it to us with the same foot. You had such control that you could kick the ball even with your left foot!"

"Ah, you didn't know that my left leg and right leg were perfect rivals. I was always extremely good with both legs. My corner kick was marvellous. It appeared like a rainbow and always dropped the ball near the goal post The ball used to go very high and it created a kind of delightful sensation. Again, when it was necessary, I used to use my left foot for what you call a grass-cutting shot. Sometimes I feel like writing more about my sports life."

I said: "How I wish you would do that! We would all be deeply moved and grateful."

Before he read out one of his articles in his room, Nolini-da said: /"Bonne fęte ŕ Tapati, bonne fęte ŕ Madhuri./ Today I shall read out something of mine and something of Amrita's. Mine is not serious but Amrita's is."

The audience burst into laughter because it was always just the opposite.

After reading out his article, Nolini-da said: "We love our country dearly and our country has also loved us dearly and it always will. India's independence is nothing short of our soul's triumphant smile."

After he had read out Amrita-da's writing, he said: "Like last time, this time also Amrita's ending is abrupt. Amrita's writing is excellent but his conclusions are abrupt. It seems to me that this is Amrita's special speciality."

Amrita-da said: "Who else can or will bless me with a special speciality if not you, Nolini?"

Kalipada-da, Rose-di and Satinath-da were working in Amrita-da's room. Around eleven o'clock in the morning Amrita-da said to me: "Chinmoy, yesterday I read your article on Raja Rammohan. You all are Bengalis here; I am the only non-Bengali. I must say that all you Bengalis are /rajas/ and /ranis/ (kings and queens) of imagination."

Rose-di said: "Amrita-da, what you say is perfectly true. But unfortunately we have all lost our kingdoms, so we are crownless kings and queens."

At this point Sahana-di entered the room. Amrita-da said: "Don't worry, Sahana can easily solve that problem for you. She can afford not only to buy you crowns but also to crown you."

Sahana-di said: "What? What? What kind of arrow, Amrita, are you hurling at me?"

"We are not aiming arrows at you. We are just admiring your supernatural capacities and qualities," he replied.

I was working in Nolini-da's room near his bed, sitting on the floor. Ranju-da came inside and said to his father: "X. Datta has criticised Rabindranath mercilessly."

Nolini-da said: "It always happens like that. People are so ungrateful. He and Basu have become well known in the literary world by virtue of Rabindranath's grace. Now look how ungrateful they are! They speak ill of Rabindranath." Then he turned towards me and said: "Chinmoy, I once got a few reprints of my article /"Rabindranath, O Uttar Pakkha."/ Do you know where the article was published?"

"Yes, it was published in /Rabindra Bharati/ and the editor of the magazine is A. K. Ghose."

"Ah," he said, "now it is your turn to retrace them."

It took me about fifteen minutes to find the reprints. He was very happy that I had found them. He said to me: "Why do I waste my time searching for things? Why do I not wait for you? Why do I make the same mistake again and again?"

Ranju-da said: "Then shall we congratulate him by wire?"

"Yes. The Mother has asked me to wire him Her blessings. Do you know where his office is?"

"Yes. Aurora Film, and I know the full address."

Nolini-da said: "That's fine."

A few minutes later Robi-da (his youngest son) entered into the room and began talking with me while I was working with the files. Then Nolini-da came in and said: "Have you heard the good news?"

Robi-da said: "No, we haven't. What is it?"

"Ajit's Nivedita film has won the President's prize and also a gold medal. We all know that twenty thousand rupees is nothing for him. But the most important thing is that he started this film with the Mother's blessings and took my advice several times while making it."

Eight-thirty a.m. I was entering the room to work. Nolini-da said to me: "Chinmoy, immediately find that Rumanian article! I need it badly. I do not know which file I put it in. This time I have really created a problem for you."

I gave him a smile and said: "No problem at all." It took me twenty minutes to find the article, which had been put in the wrong file. He was extremely happy that I had found it and he said to me: "I wanted to read it last night at the playground, but I shall read it next week. Now I shall tell you which are the important files and which are the unimportant files. As you see, there are about two hundred files. You have to take full care of them. Try to know them by heart."

I said: "I shall."

At this moment Champaklal-ji came in and said: "Nolini-da, Nolini-da, the Mother wants to dictate something." Nolini-da immediately grabbed a pencil and ran. Forty-five minutes later he came in with Amrita-da. Noticing that his face was very serious and grave, I immediately ran out of the room.

That afternoon, when I returned to the room, Ranju-da was working at his desk. As soon as I entered, Nolini-da said: "Let me tell both of you that the Mother's crisis is over." Ranju-da and I were overjoyed.

I said to Nolini-da: "I have heard that you had a very significant dream recently. Is it true?"

He said: "Yes, it is true. But I want to live in the world of reality and not in the world of dreams. For some time I wish to work on three or four things together. This red file I shall use. I shall work on my /Smritir Pata,/ on the translation of /Savitri/ and on the translation of the /Rig-Veda./ See that I don't misplace them."

"'She stands above death' -- have I translated the section that has this most significant message?

"Yes, you have done it."

"Where is it? Why don't I find it in the file?"

"It has already been printed. That is why it is not in the file."

"Printed? Then show it to me."

I showed him the Bengali magazine.

"Nolini-da, yesterday while I was at the guest house I happened to meet two old American ladies. They said they were very deeply moved by the penetrating and illumining look of your eyes. One of them bought eight books of yours and has already finished reading them. She said to me that she has gained much wisdom and light, inner and outer, from your writings. Most of all she liked your book /The Coming Race./ I told her that that was your first book, which came out even before Sri Aurobindo's /Siddhi,/ 24 November 1926 (when Sri Aurobindo attained his spiritual Perfection.) They would like a picture of you to take back to America."

Just then Rajen-da passed by and Nolini-da said to him: "Rajen, have you heard that two American ladies want to take my picture all the way to America? All right, if I cannot give them a good picture of mine I shall give them a copy of my Bengali book /Kabir Manishi./ They will find a very good picture of me in that book."

"They would like to visit Sri Aurobindo's room."

Nolini-da said: "That is Champaklal's job, so ask him. But I don't think it will be possible for him to show them Sri Aurobindo's room since the Mother is not feeling well and he has to remain with Her constantly."

Around four o'clock I was typing in the flower-room when Nolini-da came in and said: "I have spoken to Champaklal and he has agreed to show the American ladies Sri Aurobindo's room tomorrow at twelve-thirty. Go and inform them."

"You don't know where I keep things in my room? Just go and give them two copies of my book /Kabir Manishi./ I am giving them my picture and I would like them to learn Bengali. So tell them that I am giving them this book to kill two birds with one stone."

At the playground Nolini-da said: "Today I am going to tell you about the last days of my life as a revolutionary. If you follow me I can take you right up to the jail."

At the end of his talk he said: "What I have just read out is profane, non-spiritual, but now I want to read something spiritual. I will now introduce Amrita to you. This is the second instalment. I must say that Amrita is always spiritual in his writings."

After reading out Amrita-da's talk he said: "Poor Amrita, he was not fortunate enough to dine with Sri Aurobindo. Indeed, this instalment has a tragic end, but soon he will tell us about his bright light."

"Chinmoy, can you go to Sisir (Director of the Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education) and bring me a copy of the book of biographies of eminent scientists? I think he will have this book in the university library."

I immediately went to Sisir-da and told him that Nolini-da wanted to have a copy of that book.

He said to me: "Suniti is not here. When she comes back she will search for it, and if we have it she will take it to Nolini-da."

So I went back to Nolini-da's room and started working. Fifteen minutes later he came in and said: "Where is the book?"

"Sisir-da said he would send it with Suniti if they have a copy of it."

"What? Go immediately and see if he has that book. If he does not have it, then don't waste any more time. Go to Medhananda (the librarian of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram Library). I need that book urgently."

I went to Sisir-da. He said to me: "We don't have the book Nolini-da wants. Suniti says there is a book containing a few articles on the scientists, but it is a children's book. I am sure it will not serve Nolini-da's purpose.

I said to him: "You could have sent Suniti to Nolini-da. He has been waiting for the book and you promised to send it."

He said: "Well, I am sorry."

Then I went to Medhananda and got four different books entitled /The Biographies of Eminent Scientists./ Nolini-da was exceedingly glad to have these books and said to me: "Chinmoy, there was a special purpose in my asking you to go to Sisir."

"Oh no, those are my personal experiences. They are too personal."

"Rabindranath, in his /Jiban Smriti,/ and Nabin Sen, in his /Amar Jiban,/ revealed quite a few personal experiences," I said.

"Chinmoy, as you know, I am neither Rabindranath nor Nabin Sen. I am your Nolini-da and I would be embarrassed to read out those experiences in the playground."

The lamp lies unlit and dismal dark --
Bring to it the spark of your morning love and life,
The lamp is lit and burns.

The lamp burns low and dim --
Bring to it your earnest loyalty and clear adhesion,
The lamp burns high and bright.

The flame mounts slow uncertain --
Bring to it your ardent yearning and unshakeable faith,
The flame mounts swift and firm.

The flame sweeps tireless ever upward --
Call unto it the bending Grace from beyond,
The lamp has become the Sun!

Nolini-da said: "Today at my place I shall read out two things. These items are meant for children. Here I see quite a few grownups, so I would like them to become children immediately." All burst into roaring laughter.

Amrita-da said to me: "Chinmoy, come into my room. Tomorrow is my birthday, but I have started observing my birthday today. I want to give you some special food since you are a special person."

"Amrita-da, tomorrow I shall have something special for you," I said.

His immediate reply: "Since it is not easy to become a special person, I have to be satisfied in getting something special from you."

"Who says that you are not a special person?"

"Well, he who is a special person knows it and feels it."

"Amrita-da, who can outdo you in an argument?"

"Ah, I see. In that case I withdraw my point. I am indeed a special person when it is a matter of argumentation!"

At eight-thirty a.m. I presented Amrita-da with my poem translated into English by Nolini-da. He was extremely moved. He was speechless and did not want to descend to his usual humourous consciousness. In a high, contemplative mood, he said: "In silence I am telling you what I want to say about this poem."

After a few moments he said: "Chinmoy, today I will give you the best sweets, made by the best sweet-maker. Do you know who she is?"

"How can I know? Please tell me."

"She is our Shibarani, the Ashram's Shibarani, the Mother's Shibarani."

Later, I entered Nolini-da's room to work. He said to me: "Today we must observe Amrita's birthday. Here is a huge cake. Go and give it to him. We shall invite his dear ones to his room."

Then I showed Nolini-da the group picture taken on my birthday. He was very pleased. He said to me: "I need three copies: one for the Mother and two for myself."

Robi-da-also wrote a poem in Bengali about Amrita-da and asked his father to translate it into English. Nolini-da's translation of Robi-da's poem was also extremely beautiful.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

What we understand easily we believe we understand rightly,
We make a confusion between the face and its mask.
We think the horizon line is the finishing line,
We forget that a blue sky stretches still beyond.

The world is built with the tears and smiles of the gods...
A child is at play on the sandy beaches:
He is never to be met in the crowd...
A jewel knows not itself, nor does a pearl know that it is a pearl!

The goal fixed for ever, for ever he goes on,
The path offers no bar, no call reaches from behind:
Lo! The eternal voyager, eternally free,
Eyes ever turned to the dawning East, never to the setting West.

He hides behind a veil and moves on...
Is it the stream? Is it the ocean vast?

-- Nolini Kanta Gupta

The Creator in his dreaming has created
    This immortal thing in creation,
Figuring as a common creature,
    forgetful of his self:
A mystic reason makes him hide
    his own form and nature.
Ever at labour in working out
    the Impossible:
To transfigure Nature, to establish the Transcendent
    here on the bosom of material Earth,
To feed the divine sacrificial Fire
    with this human body,
With this bounded frame.
Lo, the timeless hero worker
    with this flaming faith,
Indifferent to the rude impacts of Reality,
Dreaming the victorious Mother's
    wonder dreams,
Shaping in his heart of hearts
    the golden garden of Paradise --
A faultless, sleepless, pure
    self-dedication
Has built this life into a piece of
    IMMORTALITY.

On the 22nd of September 1962 Mridu passed away.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

Unwarned by the Grim Reaper, unweighted with years
In silence off she shuffled her mortal frame.
A ceaseless fount spraying pure joy was she,

Her heart all sweet with the zeal of a daring flame.
Her heavy boat plied from shore to shore unrhymed
Of blooming, quiescent or withering souls.
A snow-white train of humour with rosy thrill
Her presence called forth in persons of varied roles.

She served her Father divine, the Lord of the gods,
With earthly manna savoured with her soul's delight.
Her heart's up-brimming transport she shared with all.
Mridu, His dove, flew quick to His golden Height.

She bodied forth a climbing, sleepless love,
Her Parents blessed her life with bending Grace.
A unique prayer the child from Him received;
Behold, ecstasy's emblem grew her face.

-- Chinmoy

#+END_VERSE

Sri Aurobindo wrote for Mridu the following to be used by her as her prayer:

/"I pray to be purified from self-will and self-assertion so that I may become docile and obedient to the Mother and a fit instrument for her work, surrendered and guided by her Grace in all I do."/

In the evening Nolini-da met me at the Ashram gate. "Oh Chinmoy, I have been looking for you. Will you go to Amal's place and give him this?" he said, handing me something. "I had to write the introduction for Sri Aurobindo's /The Human Cycle/ and /The Ideal of Human Unity/. Show it to Amal and ask him if he has any suggestions to make."

I went to Amal's house immediately and knocked at his gate. His wife opened the door. "I am so sorry to come to you at this hour," I said.

"Chinmoy, it is perfectly all right," she said. Then she called out: "Amal, Amal! Look, Chinmoy says he is sorry because he has come at this hour."

Amal said: "Chinmoy, you must know that you are always welcome. You can come at any time. Even if you have no specific reason, you can come and chat with me. You should have realised by now our mutual affection." Then he read Nolini-da's introduction.

I told him that Nolini-da wanted to see if he had any suggestions to make. He read it twice and said: "It is excellent. I have no suggestions to make." Then, with a smile, he said to me: "Sometimes when we offer suggestions to Nolini we just create unnecessary confusion for him."

"In that case, I am a real culprit. How often I offer suggestions! What is worse, sometimes they are unsolicited."

Amal said: "I have always admired your simplicity and modesty, but not your unnecessary and disproportionate humility."

At the playground Nolini-da said: "Today I shall read out to you two things; two, because they are short. One is a continuation of my previous reminiscences; the other one I won't tell you about right now."

After he had read out the first one he said: "You are all familiar with the concept of 'Hymns to the Light' but you will be surprised to learn why I am writing 'Hymns to the Darkness'." He also read out his English translations of Rabindranath's Bengali songs and of some Bengali poems by modern writers.

On our way back from the playground he asked me and Rajen-da our opinion. Rajen-da said: "Excellent!"

I said to him: "I have learnt something new: at times there is a real need for darkness."

Nolini-da was surprised and said: "Only the Mother can forgive you; nobody else on earth can. Why have you become the embodiment of falsehood?"

He said: "I do not know. But I am praying to the Mother to give me an iota of sincerity. As you know, my life and sincerity are two perfect strangers; therefore I am an object of ridicule."

Nolini-da said to him: "The Mother has definitely forgiven you. But try to make Her happy by being constantly sincere to Her and to yourself. When you try to deceive Her, which you can never do, you deliberately go millions of miles away from Her Compassion. Afterwards, it is you who suffer, and it is you who make the Mother suffer for your unthinkable insincerity.

Nolini-da's birthday. Early in the morning, at four-thirty a.m., I came to Nolini-da to offer my pranam. He blessed me and said: "I am offering you my blessings." I was very surprised and delighted to hear this, for he never uses the term 'blessing' when he outwardly or inwardly blesses someone with his silent gaze. "You can start carrying flowers upstairs," he said.

"It is not yet five."

"So what? You can start now."

I immediately took quite a few beautiful flowers upstairs. Then I began meditating in the Meditation Hall. Around five o'clock Prahllad came in and said to Nolini-da: "Nolini-da, /bonne fęte./"

Nolini-da said to him: "/Merci, merci./"

Prahllad said: "How much your age?"

Nolini-da said: "Ninety!"

Prahllad said: "Good."

Nolini-da said: "Very good."

Around six o'clock I went to give Nolini-da a book containing a poem I had written for his birthday, which had been translated into twelve languages. Norman-da came in to congratulate Nolini-da on his birthday. Nolini-da said to Norman-da: "You see what he has done for me?"

"Yes, I see it. It is very beautiful."

"In twelve languages!"

"In ancient times kings used to get things like this from their subjects and admirers. The people used to try their best to pay homage to the king in as many languages as possible."

"So today I am a king."

Both of them exchanged delightful smiles. While leaving the room, Norman-da said: "I should say it is wonderful."

Around eight o'clock Rajen-da came in. Nolini-da showed the book to Rajen-da, who said: "I don't want to see it all alone. I wish to bring some of my classmates (Nolini-da's French students)." Nolini-da's French students came in and expressed great joy when they saw the book.

Nolini-da said to them: "Now I wish to feed you. I have some special sweets for all of you."

Anima-di immediately said: "Let me get them for you to distribute."

"No, I want Ranju to do it. Ranju, where is your mother? Go and call her. It is she who should distribute the sweets." Ranju-da went out to get his mother. Nolini-da said to his students: "Stand in a line."

Prahlad and Bholonath, who were not his students, also stood in the line. Rajen-da said to them: "What are you doing here? Since when have you two become students?"

But Nolini-da said to Rajen-da: "Rajen, let them stay in the line. They are my eternal students."

The photographer Vidya Brata came in to take pictures. He took two pictures of Nolini-da and then Nolini-da said: "Now I wish to have a picture with Amrita. Chinmoy, go and call him."

I called Amrita-da, who immediately came. When Amrita-da and Nolini-da stood side-by-side, Indu-di (Nolini-da's wife), standing at the door of Bula-da, said: "Look, look! Ram and Laksman being photographed together!"

Amrita-da immediately said: "True, we are Rama and Laksmana, but Laksmana has to deserve Rama."

Indu-di said: "You do deserve Ram."

Nolini-da gave a broad smile. Amrita-da immediately left for his Tamil class.

Indu-di had a strong desire to have her picture taken with Nolini-da. I pleaded with Nolini-da to let himself be photographed with Indu-di and he agreed. I then went into Amrita-da's room to work. Indu-di came in and said: "Chinmoy, what are you doing here? Your Dada wants you to be in a picture with him."

Sushila came to greet Nolini-da. Nolini-da said: "Sushila, join us, join us."

Sushila said to me: "Chinmoy, don't be so serious. You will ruin the picture. Don't be so serious! Smile!"

The photographer immediately echoed her. Before the photograph was taken, Nirmala-di and Anima-di came in. Nolini-da asked them also to join.

Nolini-da said to us: "This morning I received a blessingful message from the Mother. It says: 'Victory of the Truth'. I wish to say, 'Victory of the Mother'."

That evening Manoj read out the English original of my poem on Nolini-da in the playground.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

Slowly Nolini petal on petal grows
    At the Feet of his Master Divine.
On him the Fount of moon-gold Vision flows;
    Through aeons its splendours shall shine.

He spreads in hush the Mother's nectar Light.
    In secret through the days
He bears the tears and smiles of our yearning's flight
    To the Mother's earth-humble Grace.

With the crescent souls a child of lucid thrill --
    They barter with his heart their bliss.
He lulls to sleep his mind's volcano-will
    In his eyes' unchanging peace.

Expunged is Ignorance-dream from his Ideal vast.
    Through the pen he bares his Soul.
He reaps the golden fruit of his tireless past;
    Now within grasp his Goal!

I went to Govinda Raj's shop, but the sandals were not ready. However, it was not his fault; his workers had unnecessarily delayed. Of course, they didn't know they were Nolini-da's sandals; otherwise, they would have done them as soon as possible. When I brought his sandals, Nolini-da complimented Govinda Raj's work.

Kalipada-da said: "Why? I don't think he will come on his own to take the money back. Pradyut has borrowed this money from him for the Ashram. He must return it to him. Whenever the Mother is in financial difficulty, Mehra (Baburam's father) helps Her. Who else would do this? He never thinks of himself or of his big family. He only thinks of the Mother and his spiritual family, the Ashram."

Around one o'clock Amrita-da took Kameshwar with him in a car and went to Baburam's place to return the money.

I searched for the address and found it mixed with the papers of an article he was writing.

In the afternoon a little boy named Mana came to Nolini-da with his mother. Nolini-da said to Mana: "Mana, is this the first time you have come to the Ashram?"

I invited Sisir-da. On the way I met Jugal-da, Parichand-da and Satinath-da. I invited them also to come at five o'clock to listen to Anirvan's tape. About fifteen lovers of literature came and Nolini-da played the tape. Nolini-da's comment: "I enjoyed it especially towards the end. I enjoyed it deeply."

"Look at the great achievement of your Chittagong," he said, showing me a brochure. They had a special celebration in honour of the Mother's birthday, 21 February. "This is all Mohini's doing (Mohini Naha). I am glad that she has not forgotten the Mother totally."

In the afternoon Nirmala-di said to me: "Nolini-da has received a letter from Roma. In the letter she mentions that she very much enjoyed your play on Sri Aurobindo: /The descent of the Blue./"

Nolini-da added: "In the last issue of the /Mother India/ it was not Chinmoy's play on Sri Aurobindo, but Chinmoy's play on me!"

A certain Mukherjee came to Nolini-da and said: "Nolini-da, Poddar is asking me to go out and give a few talks on Sri Aurobindo. What will the Mother think of it?"

Nolini-da said: "Why do you involve the Mother in this matter? If you feel it proper from within, then go. If not, remain in the Ashram peacefully."

Mukherjee said: "But I am staying in the Ashram. I cannot do anything without the Mother's permission or approval."

Nolini-da said: "Indeed, indeed, but I am afraid I don't appreciate that kind of sentiment. To have real devotion and love for the Mother is one thing, but to show this devotion and love to others is a totally different matter. Usually the Mother does not give an opinion when people want to go out and talk about Sri Aurobindo and the Mother. You make your own decision."

Mukherjee said: "In that case, I shall think it over."

In ten minutes' time he came back and said to Nolini-da: "I have weighed the pros and cons and I have come to the conclusion that Bengal needs my service. So I am going."

Nolini-da said: "That's fine. I am glad that you are not involving the Mother in this matter."

"I wanted to, but he didn't give me permission."

"That means he thinks that you know French well."

"No, it is the other way around, as far as I can tell. His students know French far better than I do and I would only create unnecessary trouble for him. That is why he does not want me to attend his French class."

"I am sure you have taken the divine attitude and are not upset at all.',

"Of course, Amrita-da, I know that Nolini-da always knows what is best for me." I told Amrita-da that I would get firsthand information from a most reliable student and bring him the news about what Nolini-da had said about him.

The utility of games and sports, especially in the spiritual life, has been brought home to us by the Divine Mother herself: 'By setting a personal example'... Had she herself not played table tennis and tennis, had she not given us direct encouragement by her presence day after day for hours on end during our sports season; had she not given each of us her smiling appreciation on every occasion, our athletic activities would not have attained the standard they now have. Seeing her take part in physical activities, elderly sadhaks like Nolini, Amrita, Pavitra, Purani, Anilbaran, the late Naren Das Gupta, Nolini Kanta Sen and others more or less of their age joined the marching exercises. Behind our girls' enthusiasm for sports and games and behind their equality with the boys in some items, even their superiority in certain events, there lies the Mother's particular concern for physical perfection.

There is no lack of foolish argument against sports in our country: "When did our ancient Yogis and saints take part in sports? If they had no such need, why should the Yogis of today have the need?" But the ancients were never without sports and amusements. The Rishi Jamadagni practised archery. It is recorded that one day he was shooting arrows and his wife, Renuka Devi, was helping him by bringing them back. The burning sun fatigued her so much that the Rishi fitted his arrow to the bow to hit the sun. Frightened, the sun-god came down. Appearing before the Rishi, he said that according to the divine dispensation his function was to give heat and light to the earth, but to save the lady from discomfort he would present her with a pair of sandals and an umbrella. It is said that since then the umbrella and shoes have been in use.

Not only did the women help their husbands and relatives in such sports; when necessary, they fought side by side with the men. When Queen Vishpala, wife of King Khela, lost her thigh on the battlefield, the twin divine physicians Aswinikumaras gave her an iron thigh at the request of the king's priest, Agastya. Was this the beginning of "artificial limbs"?

Even among the gods there was provision for happy competition. Surya, daughter of Surya, was to select the most successful competitor for her husband. The rule of the competition was that whoever reached the sun-world first would win her hand. The Aswinikumaras won the race and the prize.

Our beloved Captain, Manoj (himself a champion in athletics, an ace student of his time and an adept in histrionics, now a Professor at the Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education), has most impressively dwelt at length on /Physical Education in Ancient India/ in the April issue of our /Bulletin of Physical Education./

We now come to Nolini's athletics. The difference between an ordinary athlete and Nolini is that he takes athletics as part of Sri Aurobindo's Integral Yoga. Even after stepping into his seventieth year he has made striking progress. This has been possible by his earnest personal effort and by the Grace of the Mother. He has proved that the main enemy of athletics is not age but lack of the sense of youthfulness.

In 1955, at the age of sixty-six, despite the fact that he had practised the long jump all year, he was disqualified in all three competitive jumps before the Mother. The three rounds of laughter from the spectators vanished in the air because Nolini remained the same unperturbed figure that he always is. But he knew how such defeats affect younger nerves.

"Can an ever-happy being even in a distracted moment sense the feeling of the afflicted?

How can one who has never been bitten by a venomous snake feel its tearing pain?"

Here in the test of merit the bite is frustration. Here the Yogi has to pay the highest price of his /Karmayoga/ (Yoga in Action): /sama jaya parajayo/ (equal in victory and defeat).

Just two years later, in his sixty-eighth year, Nolini won first place in the long jump and thus reminded us of the great words of Sri Aurobindo in Savitri:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

His failure is not failure whom God leads.

#+END_QUOTE

And

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

Man can accept his fate; he can refuse.

#+END_QUOTE

If he could jump from the last possible point, then he could easily exceed his 1957 record of 3m 85cm, not by several inches but by two feet or more. For others of his age that would be an unimaginable feat.

Nervousness, though undesirable, is natural to us in the hour of competition. The goddess of sleep keeps her benign face away from us for even a week before that hour. It is a little difficult for sadhaks like us to admit that our nervousness is caused by the weakness of our vital being. Much to our Surprise, Nolini has given us no chance to see him with the jitters.

Our Amrita became a member of the Blue Group. Marching exercises he did -- unexpectedly, unbelievably, quite contrary to his nature. He left the Group a few years later. However, despite being swept up in a whirlwind of work, he would be present on the sportsground on the days of "his" Nolini's athletic competition. One can easily predict that wherever Nolini is present, Amrita is sure to be there also. Laksmana knew, and so do we, that he had no equal when he stood by Rama; Rama, too, felt in the depths of his heart:

On January 13, 1962, Nolini's birthday, an inmate of the Ashram wanted to know from Amrita if his relations with Nolini were friendly or brotherly. Amrita was silent for a while, taken aback. Then he said: "Is he my friend? You people may think so. But I always look upon him as my own elder brother." Two flowers on one stalk: such joint lives dedicated to the Mother are an example to all the Ashram.

Now for an anecdote which sounds like but is not a cock-and-bull story.

One day Abinash Bhattacharya, a fellow prisoner of our Sudhir (Captain Mona's father) in the Andamans, was witnessing the marching exercises in the Ashram playground. The sight of Nolini running upset the gentleman. He said to Sudhir: "Sudhir, stop Nolini from running. God knows when he may create a scene by falling. Is he not aware that he has long since passed his youth? I tremble at the sight of him."

"Dada," said Sudhir, "have you seen Nolini participating in the running and jumping competition?"

"Competition! At his age? If I were not an eyewitness here, I would not believe it. Of course, everything is possible for a Yogi. If I were asked to jump, I would jump over to the next world in a single bound, though I might pass the rest of my life in bed with broken limbs. Sudhir, you are laughing, but my heart skips a beat for Nolini."

Though it may sound unbelievable, in 1954, at the age of 65, Nolini breasted the tape in the 100 metre sprint with his best time of 14.9 seconds. He could easily have bettered it by one second had he been able to maintain his speed from start to finish. Alas, the last twenty metres of the race did not fully surrender to his flying feet. Of course, ninety out of a hundred suffer this fate. But never was Nolini compelled to cover the final twenty metres with the speed of a slow cycle race as did the Pakistani sprinter, of course unwillingly, in the World Olympics held in London in 1948.

In 1954 Nolini came off not only first in the 100 metre sprint but also third in the 200 metre. His time for the latter race was 32.4 seconds. But one year later the athlete Nolini rose to his best time (31.6) in the 200m sprint.

A striking event: In 1958 while practising 200m he fell after having run 40m and was hurt in two or three places. He stood up and said to his co-runner: "Who but I should fall? I could not summon the full concentration that I should have had before the start." Here is the difference between Nolini and ourselves. In such a case we blame our fate, whereas he who believes in self-effort blames his personal lapse. In a few seconds Gangaram, our genial athletic coach (himself a matchless athlete in his time), ran up to the spot and gave Nolini first aid.

In 1955 Nolini took part in the most arduous of all the races, which demands both speed and stamina: 400m. His time: 1.20.6. To compete in a 400m race at the age of 66 is surprising -- not only for an Indian, but for any athlete in the world.

Another surprise: Two years earlier he had chosen the most exacting and difficult of all the jumping events -- Hop, Step and Jump. In this he won third place, beating his fellow-competitors of less than half his age.

A sample of Nolini's timings in the 100m sprint:

1955 -- 15.2 s \\
1956 -- 15.3 s \\
1957 -- 15.3 s \\
1958 -- 15.4 s \\
1959 -- 15.4 s \\

To keep up the same standard with negligible variation for five years successively, especially in a 100m sprint, is unimaginable.

Here in the Ashram all work is part of our sadhana. To look upon success and failure with a steady eye is our first essential. Victory or defeat made no difference to Nolini, with his burning and lasting enthusiasm.

We have observed that indifference to the results cannot make for the perfection of anything. To have enthusiasm for an action whose results are of no concern to the doer is a very difficult matter.

Thou hast a right to action, but only to action, never to its fruits.

On May 29, 1953, it is doubtful if Hillary and Tenzing could have scaled Everest and planted the banner of victory on its summit had they literally followed this principle of the Gita.

In 1955 two elderly sadhaks of the Ashram participating in the athletics competition took to the track to show their worth to the Mother. They entertained no thought of victory or defeat, honour or dishonour. They had never been seen in field practice. The presented themselves on the fixed day at the fixed hour and at the fixed place for an 80m race. The group ahead of them ran off. Now it was their turn. They took their positions with some difficulty without the help of starting blocks. The stentorian orders of Pranab (Director of Physical Education) went forth one after another: "Get on your marks," "Set," "Go." Strangely, there was no sign of a start. Those nearby asked: "Why the delay?"

Turning to his co-runner, one of the two said: "Let us start then."

"You go first."

"How can I? You are on my right. We have to run abreast."

During the everyday marching exercises they had heard Pranab say: "Keep in line by dressing right." How could it be otherwise here? At last, at the impatient shouts of the spectators, they got to the position of "attention." Then their race began, based on the principle of /niskama-karma./ The two reached the finishing line together, neither preceding the other. If one slowed down a bit, the other adjusted his speed accordingly, just to keep in line. Thus they came up to the Mother. This is how our /niskama-karma/ is abused at times, reduced to a lifeless and ridiculous rule. But in every action of Nolini's one can see the full measure of his zest and enthusiasm. His interest, earnestness and enthusiasm in sports do not end with himself: he shared his feelings with all.

Nolini participated also in the hammer throw and shotput after regular and systematic practice. His coach in the hammer was his beloved Rajen, ever young, ever zealous and ever friendly to all sportsmen. Disregarding pain here and there in his body, Nolini carried on his daily practice in these two items without a break. Thoughtless fellows like us might read in this activity an ambition to win a high place. But the fact was that he was quite against pampering the pain by keeping to bed and persuading himself that he was helpless. His aim was to ignore pain and reject it altogether from his body. Indeed, herein lies the secret of a true sportsman.

There can be no shadow of a doubt that Nolini could have excelled in athletics in his school days as he did in football, had athletics been introduced in Bengal at that time.

While the author of /Swapani/ (Robi Gupta) was a student at Nilphamari H.E. School in Rangpur District, one day his playmates were deeply admiring his skill in football before their games teacher, Sri Amulya Banerjee. With a smile he said: "You have not seen his father (Nolini Kanta) play. Had you seen him..."

In 1945, the late Monsieur Benjamin introduced our rising football player, Robi Gupta, to the patron President of Cercle Sportif Ground at the end of a football match. His immediate comment was: " /Mais il ne joue pas comme son pere"/ ("But he does not play like his father").

Our Austin so liked Nolini's article on /Football/ that he sent a copy of it, along with Nolini's autographed photo, to his Canadian friends, well-known football players.

Nolini was not only a brilliant sportsman but also an athlete of the mind. At the age of only thirteen he passed the matriculation with a scholarship. Because of his tender age his father had misgivings. But his uncle was well aware of the sharpness of his intelligence and memory. Hence he encouraged him to sit for the examination. And the result was success attained with a scholarship.

What Nolini has written on relaxation in athletics is not only the result of scientific research but also a deep spiritual truth regarding the body, mind and life based on the realisation of the Yogins. We use the word "relaxation" in athletics as one counts the beads of a rosary. But most of us do not know the real signification of it. Indeed, we can derive much benefit from Nolini's personal experience. This calls to mind the famous novelist Saratchandra's words to Dilip Kumar Roy: "Do you know our difficulty? Our readers are so lazy that they would refuse to go to Heaven if it meant toiling up the stairs and if a little somersault would land them in Hell."



* Relay race

In our Ashram athletic competition it was the relay race that used to give the athletes an automatic /élan./ Competitors of all ages, from children to old men and women, would take part in this event. Tagore's immortal utterance, "There is a race about being the first to offer one's life," cannot be applied here. Here what holds is: "Who can outrun whom and win the first place?" Our former groups C and D were like East Bengal and Mohan Bagan, engaged in terrible rivalry. And their supporters also gave themselves over to wild excitement.

In 1954, Baburam and three other children of Group A outran Nolini's team and Baburam was beside himself with joy. A youth questioned him: "By outdoing old people you become so happy?"

"No, no," came the prompt reply from Baburam. "We are happy just because we were able to defeat the Secretary of the Ashram. Can you dare defeat him in anything?" The poor questioner could not find his tongue.

It was through sports that Nolini could so intimately mix with children. Even now he keeps up that capacity. There is an affinity of soft feeling between Nolini's heart and the children's.

Here is one unforgettable incident: On the first of March, 1961, at about 3 p.m., Nolini was standing in front of the room where incense sticks are lighted for us at Sri Aurobindo's /Samadhi./ A child named Gopal who enjoyed his affection happened to be there. He asked Nolini: "Such a big line, one is going behind the other to the Mother for her blessing. What do you call it in French?"

"/Queue,/" came the answer from Nolini with a gentle smile.

"No, it's wrong. My teacher Jayanti-bhai told me something else."

"All right. Ask Jayanti-bhai about the French word for 'line' and tell me tomorrow," said Nolini, patting Gopal on the back.

"No, why should I tell you?"

"I shall learn it from you."

"Then I am ready to ask Jayanti-bhai and let you know the word tomorrow."

One day Gopal will grow old. By that time most probably Nolini's French poems will be brought out in book form and Gopal as well as the rest of us will have the opportunity to read those valuable works. One day he will hear the great French savant Sylvan Levi's high appreciation of Nolini's command of French. Gopal may one day study Plato and Aristotle. Plato's comment on Aristotle was: "My academy consists of two parts -- the body of my students and the brain of Aristotle." Perhaps Gopal will then find no difficulty in pointing out the Aristotle of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. Perhaps also he will know the Matthew Arnold of Bengal in our Ashram, the author of /Adhuniki,/ one among the first hundred Bengali books, and Tagore's comment on its rival sister /Sahityika:/ "Nolini Kanta Gupta's contribution to Bengali literature is unique." According to Barindra Kumar Ghosh, "Nolini is the intellectual son ( /manas-putra/ ) of Sri Aurobindo."

Let us end this account of Nolini's athletic career on a symbolic link with his spiritual career.

Nolini beginning his sprint and finishing the race can be seen in a composite photograph which makes him start at the Mother's feet and arrive at Sri Aurobindo's -- an illustration of his Master's advice: "Accept the Mother. She will bring you to me."

Nolini-da said: "But you forgot to mention about my best time for 200 metres: 31.6 seconds."

I said: "I am so sorry. I shall insert it."

I was glad that Amrita-da was present. Although I had asked him twice to come, he told me he was not feeling well that day.

After the meeting was over I was meditating in the Meditation Hall. Amrita-da called me and I went to him. He placed his hands around my shoulders and pressed very hard, saying: "Chinmoy, I am blessing you, I am blessing you," with tremendous affection and love.

For Nolini-da. Is there anything that my heart would not be happy to do for him immediately?"

"What is that?"

"My height. No improvement!"

"I know a good cure for it."

"A way to increase my height?"

I went to Priti-di's place and asked her. Priti-di immediately said: "Go and tell Nolini-da that his time is our time. Needless to say, we are all unworthy of his boundless affection and love. All of us will definitely come to his place tonight."

Then Priti-di lovingly reprimanded me. "Chinmoy, it seems to me that you don't have the right pronunciation. You are mispronouncing my name. My name is Priti. Pri is long and ti is short. You are pronouncing both as short. Anyway, I forgive you. Let me tell you about a most significant incident in my life. When I was in my freshman year at college in Bengal, I bought a copy of Nolini-da's /Adhuniki/ and sent it to him for his autograph. Do you know what he wrote? He wrote ' /Sneher Pritike pritir sange'/ (To dear Priti, with love). You simply can't imagine how happy and delighted I was when I received Nolini-da's blessingful affection and love. And then when I saw him here in the Ashram for the first time, he spoke to me with such heavenly affection, love and concern that the experience will always be with me."
