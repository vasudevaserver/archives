On the strength of my inseparable oneness with the souls of my students all the world over, I ventured to write this book for their fastest spiritual progress.

If anybody takes these heart-rending and soul-stirring messages seriously and devotedly, and works on them cheerfully, bravely and unreservedly, they definitely will before long become supremely chosen hero-warrior-children of our Lord Absolute Beloved Supreme to fight against the age-old ignorance-night and establish His full manifestation on earth.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

God was simply shocked
To find my abominable
Plus unquestionably unpardonable
Carelessness, nay, callousness,
In not feeding Him
Every day
In the small hours of the morning
With my prayers and meditations,
Which He so desperately needs
And rightly deserves.
