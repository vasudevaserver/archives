#+BEGIN_VERSE

My foolish heart,
Who told you
That I do not love you?
Don't believe insecurity.
I tell you,
Insecurity is a graceless liar.

My foolish mind,
Who told you
That I do not need you?
Don't believe doubt.
I tell you,
Doubt is a hopeless liar.

My foolish vital,
Who told you
That I hate you?
Don't believe impurity.
I tell you,
Impurity is a shameless liar.

My foolish body,
Who told you
That I force you?
Don't believe lethargy.
I tell you,
Lethargy is a useless liar.

    There was a time
When my obscurity was my protection.

    There was a time
When my aloofness was my protection.

    But now
My heart of love is my protection.
    And
My life of service is my protection.

I am never afraid
        Of hell
    Therefore
Hell always ignores me.

I am never afraid
        Of Heaven.
    Therefore
Heaven always examines me.

I am never afraid
        Of God.
    Therefore
God always
Teaches me unreservedly,
Loves me constantly,
Perfects me untiringly.
