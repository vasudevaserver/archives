WHEN I SAID TO GOD




When I said to God,
"God, I shall leave You,"
A look of pain crossed His beautiful Face.
When I said to God,
"God, I shall stay with You
No matter what You do to me,"
God jumped up out of His Throne,
Gave me His Throne,
Gave me His Crown,
Gave me His Heart,
Gave me His All
And said
I was not only a son of His
And
A vision-fulfilling reality of His
But
His Eternity's All.
