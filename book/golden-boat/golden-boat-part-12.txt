I hate my yesterday
    Because
She told me a dark lie.
She told me that God-life
Is not meant for me.

I hate my today

She has told me a serious lie.
She has told me that God-realisation
Is not meant for me.

I hate my tomorrow

She is telling me that there is
And there can be
      No God
For an idle fellow like me.
