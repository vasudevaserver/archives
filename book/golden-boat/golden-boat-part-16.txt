We play the role of
Two unlucky souls

The barrier of nearness
At times does exist.
      But why?
      Because
The seeker does not surrender
His earthbound fondness to
The Master-leader;

The seeker builds a paradise of his own
   Where he wants to possess
   The Master ceaselessly
Before the Master
   Claims and proclaims him
   Compassionately and proudly
      As his own, very own.
