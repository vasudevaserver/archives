We play the role of
Two unlucky souls

THE BARRIER OF NEARNESS




The barrier of nearness
At times does exist.
But why?
Because
The seeker does not surrender
His earthbound fondness to

Where he wants to possess
The Master ceaselessly
Before the Master
Claims and proclaims him
Compassionately and proudly
As his own, very own.
