#+BEGIN_VERSE

Lord, is sleep death or rest?
"Son, sleep is death; sleep is rest.
Sleep is fulfilling rest
When angels visit you
Or
You enter into the world
Of the illumining Beyond.
Sleep is death
When the vital world
Of
Destruction-night
Threatens you and frightens you.
Sleep is death
When you fail to see
The flow of Eternity's river
In
Your consciousness-realm."

#+BEGIN_VERSE

Each thought is precious
When we live in the world
Of desire.
A precious thought blossoms
In the Garden
Of God's gracious Light.
A precious will is born
In the Heart
Of God's Intuition bright.
A precious surrender is born
When God and man
Barter their precious treasures:
Man, his agelong ignorance-sea;
God, His Infinity's Peace and Bliss.

My sweet Lord,
Do You cover
My falsehood-life,
Impurity-breath
And
Bondage-night?
"My sweet daughter,
I cover them not;
Again, I expose them not.
I claim your possession-world
As my reality's substance
And essence.
Therefore
I own your little world
And
I endeavour to change the face
Of your little world
To My Satisfaction-Light."

#+BEGIN_VERSE

Lord Supreme,
I smile to draw the attention
Of my little world around me.
But why do You smile?
What makes You smile?
"My daughter,
Nothing compels Me to smile.
Nothing compels Me to do anything.
But yet I do and act,
For I know I am not only the Doer
But also the action;
I am not only the Speaker
But also the speech.
If I fail to unite My creation-flower
With My Creator-seed,
Nothing can breathe on earth
Even for a fleeting second.
My child, I smile
Because inside the Heart of My Smile
Beauty's day dawns;
Inside the Body of My Smile
Duty's morn breaks."

Lord Supreme,
Is there any difference
Between
Your supernal Grace
And
Reality's face?
"My daughter sweet,
No difference at all.
I tell you a secret supreme:
The outer world,
My outer creation,
Pays no attention
To the Omnipotent power of Grace.
But I depend, on earth,
On the descending flow
Of My own transcendental Grace.
My Grace is not only My preparation-seed
But My Perfection-Tree."

#+BEGIN_VERSE

My sweetest Lord Supreme,
Is self-forgetfulness
A divine blessing
Or
An animal curse?
"Self-forgetfulness can never be
A curse.
It can only be
A sad experience
In a seeker's ever running and
Transcending journey
To the Beyond.
The self-forgetfulness of puny 'i'
Is a blessing supreme indeed,
As the self-remembrance of the giant 'I'
Is an unparalleled blessing
On the seeker's march along the path
Of reality's space.
Forget the sad and the saddening past;
Remember the illumining
and the illumined present.
Accelerate the birth and the life-flow
Of the fast-approaching future-noon.
Before the dawn of realisation-height,
Self-forgetfulness at times saves
The seeker's inner sky
And outer moon.
After the birth of realisation-height,
Self-forgetfulness in the heart
Of a Master divine
Is the zenith of impossibility remote."

Do you know
What God told me the other day?
I am telling you
In top secrecy.
If you breathe a word to God
I shall never tell you anything again.
Remember, be careful!
Needless to say,
God has shared with me
Millions of His sacred secrets.
Now I shall share with you
His first secret:
At the end of your journey's close
Your epitaph will read
'An unfulfilled tear of God';
My epitaph will read
'A fulfilled smile of God.'
Remember, be careful!
If you breathe a word to God
I shall not share anything else with you;
No, not even the precise hour
of your God-realisation
Which God told me
Only this morning
In top secrecy.

O my doubter-mind,
Since we need each other
So desperately
And
Since we do not need God at all,
Let us do one thing:
Let us escape from God's world
And create a world of our own.
Then we can challenge God
And
His Believer-Heart.
O my doubter-mind,
Even if we lose
To God and His Believer-Heart,
No harm!
Together we shall remain independent
Of our Lord Supreme.
Is this not the accomplishment
Unparalleled
Since the birth of the Creator Himself?

Lord, why am I suffering so much?
"You are suffering
Because you are a sleeping body."
Lord, why am I suffering so much?
"You are suffering
Because you are a demanding vital."
Lord, why am I suffering so much?
"You are suffering
Because you are a doubting mind."
Lord, why am I suffering so much?
"You are suffering
Because you are an unaspiring heart."
Lord, why am I suffering so much?
"You are suffering
Because you are an unillumining soul."
Lord, is there any way I can be happy?
"Yes, you can.
Just tell your body
That its boss is your dynamic vital.
Just tell your vital
That its boss is your searching mind.
Just tell your mind
That its boss is your surrendering heart.
Just tell your heart
That its boss is your fulfilling soul.
Just tell your soul
That its boss is your
Dream-transforming
And
Reality-immortalising God."
