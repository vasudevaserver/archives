#+BEGIN_VERSE

Life is a battle
   Between
Desire-warriors
   And
Aspiration-warriors.

God
Does not want
Desire-warriors
To win
   Because
They want to dominate
      The world.

God
Desperately wants
Aspiration-warriors
To win
   Because
They want to liberate
      The world.

   Of Universal Love
      And
   Transcendental Truth
In your heart-cry.
