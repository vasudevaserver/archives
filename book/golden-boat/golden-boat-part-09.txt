WHEN I SEE DEATH'S HAND

When I see Death's hand
On your face,
My heart just breaks.
How I wish you could stay
On earth
A few more good and God-years!

When I see Death's hand
On your heart,
My heart just breaks.
I blame, I blame God
Because He has not granted you
Even an immortal human birth.

TWO GREAT AMBITIONS

Two great ambitions have I.
I want to see
If God can manage to exist
On earth
And
In Heaven
Without my conscious and constant support.
I want to see
If any soul
On earth
Or
In Heaven
Has ever displeased God
More than my demanding and possessing life.

To change the face and fate of earth
In the world of death.

From earth-failure to Heaven-triumph
To change the sorrows and pangs of God
In the world of man.

His followers cannot live
Without touching and polluting his feet.
