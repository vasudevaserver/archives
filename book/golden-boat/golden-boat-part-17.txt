THE COSMIC TASK




A human life neglected,
A cosmic plan unfinished.
A human life regulated,
A cosmic task that has reached its zenith goal.
He who neglects
Is a failure in God's Eye.
He who leaves his task unfinished
Again and again must come
To the earthly shores to complete his task:
The task of earth-transformation
And his own body-perfection.
