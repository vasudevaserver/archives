Master, Master,
What is the difference
Between my faith in you
And your faith in me?

Entirely depends on
Your heart's love-strength
And
Your life's surrender-length."

Master, Master, over the years
I have given you so many things.
It seems to me that you have shown me
No sense of appreciation.
Master, this time I have
Two very special gifts for you.
I am sure you will enjoy them.
"My child, tell me, tell me.
I am all eagerness."
Master, this time I shall give you
My gratitude-heart
And my surrender-life-
Beauty-fountains.

Leave it with me just for an hour.
I will do the needful."
