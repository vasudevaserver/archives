#+BEGIN_VERSE

Netaji, I bow to your indomitable soul.
Netaji, I bow to your indefatigable life.
Netaji, I bow to your sleepless and breathless
India-independence-dream.

Netaji, I am now here in Tokyo, Japan.
I am here at your blessingful Renko-ji Temple.
It is here that I am hearing your oneness-heart-bell
Constantly ringing.

Netaji, I am here at your peaceful shrine.
It is here that India's independence-dreamers,
India's independence-lovers,
And India's independence-fighters
Proudly, voraciously and regularly dine.

Netaji, it is here at your fruitful Long Home
That India's division-foolishness,
Division-blindness
And division-madness
Unmistakably fail to roam.

Netaji, beauty of the Bengali heart you were.
Netaji, responsibility of the Indian life you were.
Netaji, capacity of the sub-continent-unity you were.

Japan, O beauty's land,
Lovingly, affectionately, devotedly and self-givingly
You treasure our beloved Netaji.

My Bengali aspiration-heart,
My Indian dedication-life
And my world-peace-manifestation-dream
Love you.

They call me a dreamer. I confess I am a dreamer. I have always been a dreamer-even when I was a child. The progress of the world has depended on dreamers and their dreams-not dreams of exploitation and aggrandisement and perpetuating injustice, but dreams of progress, happiness for the widest masses, liberty and independence for all nations.

I have been a dreamer of dreams. But the dream of all my dreams, the dearest dream of my life, has been the dream of freedom for India.

They think it is a discredit to be a dreamer. I take pride in being one. They do not like my dreams. But that is nothing new.

If I did not dream dreams of India's freedom, I would have accepted the chains of slavery as something eternal.

The real crux of the question is, can my dreams become realities? I submit they have increasingly become realities. The army is one such dream come true.

No, I do not mind being a dreamer.

On 4 July 1943 in Singapore, Netaji became the President of the Indian Independence League. His powerful oratory and life-illumining vision captivated the entire audience:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

"Comrades! You have voluntarily accepted a mission that is the noblest that the human mind can conceive of. For the fulfilment of such a mission no sacrifice is too great, not even the sacrifice of one's life. You are today the custodians of India's national honour and the embodiment of India's hopes and aspirations."

Three and a half months later, on 21 October 1943, Netaji first announced the formation of the Provisional Government of Free India:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

"In the name of God, in the name of by-gone generations who have welded the Indian people into one nation and in the name of the dead heroes who have bequeathed to us a tradition of heroism and self-sacrifice, we call upon the Indian people to rally around our banner and to strike for India's freedom."

"My soldiers! Let your battle-cry be 'To Delhi! To Delhi!' How many of us will survive this war of freedom I do not know. But I do know this: that we shall ultimately win and our task will not end until our surviving heroes hold the victory parade on another graveyard of the British Empire."

Suddenly he was sobbing; tears rolled down his cheeks. There was dead silence. No one could help him. All were helpless.

Netaji never gave up and he never lost hope. When there was no possibility for him to fruitfully serve his beloved country from inside India, he went to Germany and then to Japan-at great personal risk. Immediately after the Japanese surrender in 1945, Netaji decided that he would go to Russia to carry on his fight from there. No land was too far for him to reach, no danger too great for him to brook. Even after the I.N.A.'s defeat in 1944 at Imphal, near the Burmese border in India, Netaji declared:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

"Once, during a mammoth meeting in Rangoon, a garland which Netaji had been wearing during the earlier part of the meeting was auctioned. The first bid which was given in the name of Indian independence was for one lac of rupees. A youth cried out: 'Two lacs.' Then the bidding increased: three, four, five, six, seven lacs. The youth could put up with it no longer. He ran towards the pulpit and said: 'Netaji, I give everything that belongs to me. I lay all my property at your feet.'

When others uttered the motto "Come together,"
There was no conviction.
But when Netaji voiced forth,
"Come, come together,"
Specially when he was forming the I.N.A.,
Many Indians living in foreign countries
Gave him their lives, their blood and their all
Lovingly, self-givingly and unconditionally.

Netaji often showed his oneness-heart to his beloved soldiers. He shared the same austere life and he often used to eat with them. At all times, he insisted on receiving exactly the same treatment as everybody else:

Since Netaji was the Commander-in-Chief, he used to be given four pieces of bread at meal time. One day he happened to notice that the regular soldiers were served only two pieces. He asked them, 'Why are you giving me four pieces when your portion is only two?'

They said, 'You are our leader, so you deserve more.'

'I deserve more?' said Netaji. 'Have I not established my oneness with you all? What kind of justice is it that you get two and I get four? Take them away!'

They removed the extra pieces from Netaji's plate and he happily declared, 'Now I am ready to eat. I cannot have more than you who are my dearest brothers. There should be equal treatment.'

Please accept my pranam and convey the same to Mother....

"Where are those high-souled seers today? Do we hear their prayers any more? There is no more of their yoga, their prayers, their worship, etc.... We have lost our religion, and everything else...even our national life.

"Will not any son of Mother India in distress, in total disregard of his selfish interests, dedicate his whole life to the cause of the Mother? ...We must now shake off our stupor and lethargy and plunge into action...." Thus wrote Subhas Chandra Bose to his mother when he was a boy of fourteen.

Even before he reached adolescence, Subhas Chandra accepted the land of his birth as the Holy Land despite its present degradation, worshipped India as the Mother Divine from day to day, completely prepared to sacrifice his all, even life itself, for her deliverance. He found his 'Swadharma' in 'Karma' and plunged into a life of ceaseless activity and struggle.

But, the indefatigable warrior did pause from time to time for prayer and meditation without ever making any demonstration of them. He returned from his meditation with renewed mental strength and determination and resumed his struggle.

The India that we have today is not the India that Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose worked, fought battles across the world and sacrificed his life for. For their own sake and for the emancipation of the land of their birth, Indians must re-discover Subhas Chandra Bose. Netaji's Book of Life must become their gospel. As he has said in his Political Testament: "...no suffering, no sacrifice is ever futile. It is through suffering and sacrifice alone that a cause can flourish and prosper and in every age and clime the eternal law prevails-'the blood of the martyr is the seed of the church.' ...One individual may die for an idea but that idea will, after his death, reincarnate itself in a thousand lives...."

While under house arrest by the British, Subhas made plans for his escape from India. His decision was taken after months of prayer and meditation. Initially Subhas confided only in his beloved nephew, Sisir. Together they spent hours formulating the details. When all was settled, Subhas took his brother Sarat and Sarat's wife, Bivabati, into his confidence.

Subhas escaped at one-thirty in the morning on 17 January 1941, wearing Muslim dress. Fully sixty-two members of the British C.I.D. (Criminal Intelligence Department) were staked outside and near Subhas Chandra's home. His nephew drove him to the train station and Subhas made his way north towards Kabul, Afghanistan. He carried with him only a copy of the Bhagavad Gita, a picture of Mother Kali and his tulsi japa beads. When the C.I.D. learned of his disappearance after 10 days, they searched for him throughout the length and breadth of India. Following two months and eleven days of danger and suspense, Subhas arrived safely in Berlin in the guise of an Italian nobleman, Signor Orlando Mazzotta (as shown in the above photo). His journey from Calcutta, in the middle of the war, ranks among the most sensational escapes of history.

Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had said: "I believe in God. I also believe in prayer." He also said that for him, spirituality consisted in two kinds of practices.

The first of these was the practice of self-assertion. He told himself that he had overcome the human frailties such as lust, anger, temptation and fear. "This practice gives me a lot of strength and through it I have overcome many weaknesses," he said.

The other practice was self-surrender. In his words: "I am but an instrument in the hands of the Divine.... I try to repeat in my mind 'Thy Will be done' in a spirit of self-surrender."

Is it not wonderful that India's only warrior-statesman was also a deeply spiritual person? On the occasion of his hundredth birth anniversary let us remember what he once said: "Let us dream of an India for which it would be worthwhile to give all that we have...." We must dedicate ourselves to this ideal once again.

I cannot close this chapter without mentioning the genuine, authoritative and illumining books about Netaji that have been written by Dr. Sisir Kumar Bose and Dr. Krishna Bose. No student of Indian history can hope to fathom the loftiest ideals and the most significant events of the years before India's independence without reading the first and foremost biography of Netaji, Dr. Sisir Bose's immortal book, The Flaming Sword Forever Unsheathed.

Again, he is the only one, aside from Netaji himself, who could have described the unimaginably daring and dangerous sequence of events leading to Netaji's escape from Calcutta, India. At every moment death threatened to embrace not only Netaji but Sisir Bose himself. This has been most lucidly and inimitably narrated in his book The Great Escape. Netaji's escape was the question of questions. His nephew Sisir Kumar's book, The Great Escape, is the only answer.

I also found a great deal to learn in Dr. Krishna Bose's book Netaji: A Biography for the Young. This most significant and instructive historical account has been written by her expressly for the younger generation.

At the eleventh hour, while I was writing this book in Japan, I was able to procure copies of her two immortal books Itihaser Sandhane and Charanrekha Taba from America. To my heart's greatest delight, I discovered that Dr. Krishna Bose had made pilgrimages to Germany and a few European countries (Itihaser Sandhane) and, a few years later, to Japan and some Asian countries (Charanrekha Taba) in order to trace the hallowed footsteps of Netaji. With a curious mind and a throbbing heart, she visited the places where Netaji's memories have been preserved sacredly, glowingly and proudly. These books provide a vast wealth of first-hand information-experiences about Netaji's most laudable activities in those countries. They are at once vividly informative and soulfully contemplative.

Indeed, these books, along with their other works, are indispensable if we desire to admire the beauty and adore the fragrance of Subhas Chandra's universal heart.

Yet Netaji was at heart a spiritual man, a man interested in philosophy and religion, a man of strong personal convictions and at the same time of great tolerance for other creeds, of respect for other ethnic groups and the dignity of man and woman in general.

Even though Netaji passed out of India's history more than half a century ago, many of his principles and ideas are modern even by today's standards. We can all but wish that more people in India-as well as other countries-today would embrace many of these principles: the tolerance for others, the importance of the role of women and of the down-trodden classes, the fierce belief and love in India, the dedication to his country and his country's people.

As his daughter I will always regret that I never had a chance to really know him and learn from him first-hand.

To me, a child of twelve in the hills of Lanka,
The friendly captain of the nearby camp, Sengupta
Hailing from Sonar Bangla of poetic dreams,
Spoke of its heroes of science and letters,
And gallant fighters for India's liberty:
Bose the scientist, Bankim the novelist,
Tagore the poet of infinite wisdom.
But the hero of his heroes-and thus, indeed, mine too-
Was none other than that man of steel,
NETAJI who urged action while others chose words.

In 1976 Siddhartha Shankar Ray, who was then chief minister of West Bengal, expressed the feelings of many Indians when he said, "Bose is undying and will live forever."

Siddhartha Shankar Ray is the grandson of Chitta Ranjan Das, the most revered political guru of Subhas Chandra. As India's Ambassador to the U.S.A., as a long-time Member of Parliament, and as a distinguished advocate, Ambassador Ray has made a notable and unique contribution to his country.

On 17 November 1995, during his term as Ambassador to the U.S.A., he very graciously introduced Sri Chinmoy's Peace Concert in Washington, D.C. before an audience of 10,000 peace-lovers.

In February 1996, on the eve of the departure of Ambassador Ray and his wife Maya Devi for India, Sri Chinmoy with his students gave them a farewell party during which he highly praised them as "two colossal souls to unite India the Prayerful with America the Beautiful."

"Respected Chinmoy,

It is in the fitness of things that a Patriot as ardent as yourself should celebrate the Hundredth Birth Anniversary of the Prince of Patriots Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. The 20th Century is about to fade away and the 21st to begin but even with the passing of centuries, Indians will forever proclaim Netaji as the greatest son of 20th century India and keep embedded in their Hearts his perennial message of love, hope, freedom and sacrifice.

With Respects,"

Siddhartha Shankar Ray

15 January 1997



"I was a small child in the early 'Thirties' when Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose visited my parent's home in London. The late Dr. Kiran Chandra and Asha Lata Bhattacharyya.

Very diffidently I advanced towards him and held out an autograph book for him to sign. He bent down and took the book from my small hands and wrote thus:

'Bideshey thekey neejer desh-key chintey shikho' in translation- 'while living outside your own country, learn to know of it.'

This has been my sole inspiration ever since I returned to this much loved country of mine, fifty years ago, from England. I still have not ceased learning."

When Subhas begged Mahatma to embark on the Quit India Movement, Mahatma failed to see eye-to-eye with him.

Subhas Chandra's heart was tortured by tenebrous pangs. His friends and admirers begged him to voice forth the Quit India Movement himself.

Subhas Chandra's wisdom-flooded mind said to them, "If I declare 'Quit India,' only a few million may respond, whereas if Mahatma, the Father of the Nation, emphatically makes the same statement, the entire nation will jump, run and fly to please him in no time. Therefore, by no manner of means am I the right person. Our Mahatma, our Himalayan Father of the Nation, is the only one-"

After Subhas had left India, Mahatma stoically announced to the world that the heart-rending slogan "Quit India," which Subhas had wanted him to introduce, was to be used by all Indians. It spread throughout the length and breadth of the sub-continent like wildfire.

Here, again, Subhas was right. When Mahatma said, "Quit India," the entire nation accepted it devotedly, proudly and self-givingly. Alas, at this point, Mahatma's sincerity-heart was found somewhere beyond Infinity's farthest shore. Nowhere did he acknowledge the true source of this slogan.

To err is human. Therefore, Mahatma, the politician-patriot-mind, committed a few painful plus irrevocable blunders.

When Subhas won his second term as President of the Indian National Congress against Dr. Pattabhi Sitaramayya, Mahatma could not accept Subhas Chandra's victory happily, cheerfully and proudly.

To our greatest sorrow, Mahatma tried unimaginably hard to make Sitaramayya win. He said to the nation, quite surprisingly and, more so, shockingly, "Pattabhi Sitaramayya's defeat is my defeat."

Furthermore, he asked Nehru, Patel and others of the front-rank leaders to boycott Subhas. Needless to say, they obeyed him, as they always did in those days, so there was nothing surprising about their action.

In two weeks' time, Mahatma advised them to form a new party or working committee and designate posts. Gandhi-ji said he would guide them.

During those days, Subhas was bedridden. His fever rose up to 106 degrees. Hard was it for him to breathe. His eyes failed to listen to his command. Nevertheless, he wanted to visit the conference where they were deciding who would get what posts.

When Nehru, Patel, Azad and others-all leaders of the highest order- saw that Subhas was brought to the stage on a stretcher, in no time they came down from the platform and disappeared.

Was Subhas so undesirable? Or did self-doubt and fear torture them? God alone knows. When Subhas had recuperated and was forming his cabinet again, Gandhi-ji's staunch followers stood against him. Subhas became a true victim to sadness and frustration.

He said to himself, 'If Mahatma does not want me, and his dear ones do not want me, then it is useless, utterly useless, for me to continue serving as President for the second time.'

He resigned. To quote Netaji's own words, "Owing to the morally sickening atmosphere at Tripuri, I left that place with such a loathing and disgust for politics as I have never felt before during the last nineteen years...I prayed for light in my dark mind. Then, slowly, a new vision dawned on me, and I began to recover my mental balance, as well as my faith in man and in my countrymen. After all, Tripuri was not India....In spite of what I had experienced in Tripuri, how could I lose my fundamental faith in man? To distrust man was to distrust the divinity in him-to distrust one's very existence."

Look at the meanness of Subhas Chandra's long-standing so-called compatriot-friends versus the unimaginable nobility of Professor Oaten at the Presidency College in Calcutta! While Subhas was a student there, Professor Oaten, who was British, ruthlessly criticised India on more than one occasion. Subhas could not brook these untold insults to his Indian brothers. He took off his shoe and thrashed Professor Oaten black and blue.

The same Professor Oaten, after Subhas Chandra's passing, wrote a poem highly appreciating and admiring Subhas:

#+BEGIN_VERSE

Did I once suffer, Subhas, at your hand?
Your patriot heart is stilled! I would forget!
Let me recall but this, that while as yet
The Raj that you once challenged in your land
Was mighty, Icarus-like your courage-planned
To meet the skies, and storm in battle set
The ramparts of High Heaven, to claim the debt
Of freedom owed, on plain and rude demand.
High Heaven yielded, but in dignity
Like Icarus, you sped towards the sea.
Your wings were melted from you by the sun,
The genial patriot fire that brightly glowed
In India's mighty heart and flamed and flowed
Forth from her Army's thousand victories won!

India was divided. According to many, Jawaharlal Nehru and Vallabhbhai Patel were fully responsible for the amputation of Mother India's body.

But the seekers of the highest Truth, when they dive deep within, can clearly see and emphatically say that it was Gandhi-ji who, through his never-to-be-caught actions and manners, prompted Nehru and Patel to long for a divided India.

Why? For two reasons. Firstly, Gandhi-ji was convinced that it would be impossible for Nehru, Patel and others to rule the country in the face of the ceaseless demands of the Muslim insurgents. Secondly, Gandhi-ji wished to keep his Muslim brothers happy. He said, 'Over my dead body only can Muslims ever be mistreated by the Hindus.'

To the truth-seekers and truth-discoverers, it is crystal-clear that Mahatma was fully responsible for the separation-destruction of poor Mother India.

When the leaders of the nation disobeyed Mahatma, he felt compelled to issue his supreme ultimatum, namely a fast unto death.

At one time, according to Pakistan, India owed Pakistan a very large sum of money. Nehru and Patel did not want to give the money. They said, 'True, we owe them this sum, but we do not want to give it right now. Already we are at daggers drawn. If they get the money, they will only buy weapons to humiliate us. In the course of time, we shall give it to them, but the time has not come.'

Then Gandhi-ji said, 'Look, I am going to fast unto death if you do not give Pakistan the money which we are supposed to give.'

Helpless as he was in the face of Mahatma's vow, Sardar Patel lost his temper. He said, "Gandhi-ji is not prepared to listen to me. He seems determined to blacken the names of the Hindus before the whole world."

Patel was compelled to give the full amount to Pakistan.

"DEEPLY CONCERNED OVER SUBHAS' DISAPPEARANCE. CONVEY TO MOTHER MY SYMPATHY. KINDLY KEEP ME INFORMED NEWS."

Sarat Chandra Bose wired back:

"MOTHER AND WE PROFOUNDLY TOUCHED BY MESSAGE. NO NEWS SUBHAS YET DESPITE UTMOST EFFORTS LAST FEW DAYS. HOPE HE WILL HAVE YOUR BLESSINGS WHEREVER HE MAY BE."

Mahatma also sent a telegram to the family. He said to them:

This time Sarat wisely threw out a red herring. His reply was:

"Father of our Nation! In this holy war for India's liberation, we ask for your blessings and good wishes."

#+END_QUOTE

To the end he looked upon Gandhi-ji as the Father of the Nation. He maintained his nobility-flooded demeanour towards the elders in spite of repeated arguments and frustrations.

Mahatma and Netaji shared the same deplorable fate. Mahatma's dear ones, to a great extent, displeased him, if not deserted him. They used to meet with him quite infrequently. On one occasion he went to Delhi Station with one of his faithful assistants, Jayaprakash Narayan. No, not even one political leader came to receive him. This was what Mahatma's fate had become.

Mahatma, in the evening of his life, said, 'I have sadly failed. I wanted to have an undivided India, but it is nothing short of impossibility.'

In Netaji's case also, his Heaven-blessed dream was to come to Delhi with his Indian National Army and throw the British Government completely and irrevocably out of India. Alas, Netaji sadly suffered disappointment.

In the outer world we notice two colossal souls with unfulfilled dreams. But when we dive deep within, we faultlessly see that two absolutely supreme patriots were trying to illumine the firmament of India and make it bright, brighter, brightest.

Through the Free India Centre which Netaji established in Germany, Rabindranath Tagore's song /Jana Gana/ Mana was played and sung for the first time in Hamburg on 29 May 1942.

Simultaneously, India's tri-colour banner was hoisted, along with the German flag. The German national anthem was then played.

The Mayor of Hamburg gave Netaji the warmest welcome.

Eventually, Tagore's /Jana Gana/ was adopted as the official national anthem of independent India. Once again, Gandhi-ji and Nehru followed Netaji's lead.

The Muslim leader, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, spoke about Gandhi-ji in his own characteristic way. To quote him:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

"To see the Hindu leader, Gandhi, is a difficult task. To understand him is an infinitely more difficult task. Whenever he is unable to answer our queries satisfactorily, he advises us to dive within and get the message from our inner existence. When there are very awkward questions to be answered, he often takes refuge in a pencilled message, saying, 'This is my day of silence.' I say, to hell with his inner light! Why can't he be honest and admit he has made a mistake or that he does not know the answer?"

#+END_QUOTE

Clearly, Mr. Jinnah's heart was made of steel and not of marshmallow!

On the other hand, Subhas Chandra was able to come to an agreement with Jinnah in 1939 which allowed Hindus and Muslims to live and work together. It was known as the Bose-League Pact.

Gandhi-ji's supreme philosophy is "Truth is God." Once he realised what the real truth actually was, he desperately tried to abide by the truth. Most of the time he was crowned with success. To give an example, in the beginning he thought Subhas did the wrong thing by leaving India. Then he came to realise that Subhas did the right thing. In the beginning he found it difficult to appreciate Subhas Bose wholeheartedly. In later years he appreciated Subhas with all his heart.

Gandhi-ji's adherence to truth we notice right from his school days. He always told the truth. According to him, the soul-force is infinitely more important than any other force. Not only did he realise this, but also he tried to inspire each and every Indian with the loftiest doctrine, India's immortal motto /Satyameva jayate/ (Truth alone triumphs). This, indeed, is Mahatma Gandhi, the inner breath, and Mahatma Gandhi, the outer life.

Their most auspicious second meeting was without doubt a Heaven-blessed coincidence. It took place when Subhas was returning to India in 1921 after his years at university in England, and Rabindranath happened to be a fellow passenger on the boat. Tagore and Subhas engaged in many heart-to-heart conversations. The Poet, who was Subhas Chandra's senior by thirty-six years, did offer the young man his sincere congratulations for having resigned so bravely from the I.C.S. Subhas, on his side, found in Rabindranath a kindred spirit -- for had not the Poet renounced his knighthood following the massacre of his countrymen by the British at Jallianwalla Bagh?

In his later years, the Poet openly traced the ripening of his esteem for Subhas and revealed his early apprehensions:

In 1940 Tagore requested an interview with Subhas. In spite of his deepest love, deepest admiration and deepest respect for Tagore, it took Subhas two long months to offer him an interview, for Subhas had been inundated with myriad activities since resigning the Presidency in April 1939.

Finally, on 2 July, Tagore came and met with him in Calcutta for about two hours. Afterwards, Tagore left for Santiniketan, only to hear on his return that Subhas had been arrested-just three fleeting hours after the interview had taken place. It was to be his eleventh and last imprisonment.

Since Subhas Chandra's arrest was ill-founded, he challenged the authorities. On 29 November he announced that he would fast until death embraced him. After one week, the authorities took him seriously, removed him from jail and placed him under home-internment. It was from there that Subhas escaped and made his sad and glad exit from his Mother India's shores. His body could not return, but his entire inner being returned and became the supremely beloved child of Mother India.

/First Scene/

/Place:/ The Garden Of Eden

/The children of the cosmic gods are singing in Heaven "Bishwabasir joy..." -- "Victory to the citizens of the world..."/

/Enter Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose/

/Netaji:/ Since I left India, I have never heard such a soul-stirring song! The sentiment, the thought, the language, the rhythm, the melody, the tone -- each and every petal of this song-flower is unique, and the flower itself is intoxicating me with its beauty and fragrance. Since I left my Mother Bengal, I have never heard such a beautiful song. But alas, I thought that it was the children of Bengal who were singing the song. Now I see that it is the children of the cosmic gods who are singing.

Where am I? Where is my Motherland? O my Mother India, I do not mind in the least if I am not favoured with a place among those who sacrificed their all to liberate you from the cruel shackles of British domination. My only sorrow is that you are still in stark bondage, ruthlessly insulted and painfully humiliated at every moment.

/From the opposite side, enter Deshapriya (another martyr from Chittagong; "Deshapriya" means one who is dear to Mother Bengal)/

/Deshapriya:/ Ah, Netaji! You are here! I am so fortunate today to meet with Mother India's greatest and most beloved son. Your name and your supreme glories are echoing and re-echoing throughout the length and breadth of India. I have just come from our Motherland, where I paid a short visit.

/Netaji:/ You are coming from India? Tell me, tell me, how is our eternal sufferer, Mother Bengal? Mahatma, Jawaharlal and others -- how are they? What are they doing?

/Deshapriya:/ Our Mother India is free! The English have left our Motherland on their own.

/Netaji:/ Tell me, tell me more! Why do you stop? Am I in a fantasy-world? Our Motherland is liberated? Our one and only dream has been fulfilled? Then how is it that you are not happy in the least? On the contrary, your eyes are flooded with tears.

/Deshapriya:/ Alas, our Mother India is now divided. She can no longer pride herself on the oneness of her sweet children. The whole of India is drenched with the blood of Hindus and Muslims. Poverty, untold misery and catastrophe have become India's daily companions. My Mother Chittagong has fallen under the inexorable curse of division. The poisonous air of division-night is about to devour and destroy me completely. There is no food, no clothing; only birthless and deathless fear. Premature death, accidental death and unnatural death: this is what India's fate has become. Soon, Netaji, I shall visit Bengal again. My sole aim, like yours, is to unite India. We must uproot the separation-poison-tree!

/Netaji:/ What are you saying, Deshapriya? I am unable to understand you. On my way to Japan from Singapore, I fell asleep in the plane, and then I do not know what happened to me. One thing I do remember, though, is that my dearest and fondest Azad Hind Fauj, our Indian National Army, failed to bring about India's independence.

/Deshapriya:/ No mighty endeavour can forever remain unfulfilled, Netaji. At God's choice Hour, God Himself lovingly breathes life into our glorious dreams. True, your Azad Hind Fauj could not give India her freedom, but you and your indomitable army of liberation-fire will forever and forever remain immortal in the heart-history of India. Even Mahatma has bowed to you and your army with tremendous admiration.

/Netaji:/ Enough, enough, my dear friend! No more embarrassment! What I have done for my Mother Bengal is next to nothing; what I have done for my Mother India is next to nothing. Now tell me, are they honouring our beloved Deshabandhu [Chitta Ranjan Das], our political Guru, whose lofty inspiration I imbibed at my journey's start? Today I want to prostrate myself at his mighty feet. He was my blue-vast inspiration-ocean. If my cherished countrymen have even an iota of appreciation for me, then I am offering it all to him, for it is he alone who rightly deserves it. His boundless affection-smiles and unparalleled wisdom-teachings have made me what I am now. My earth- bound-life and my Heaven-free-soul are profusely and eternally grateful to him.

/Deshapriya:/ Indeed, dear Netaji, it is his unconditional blessings that have also made me what I am now. Let us go and pay our prayerful homage to our beloved Deshabandhu. I am sure he will be overwhelmed with joy to see you!

/Place:/ Deshabandhu's Palace In Heaven

/Deshabandhu and Pandit Motilal Nehru, Jawaharlal Nehru's father, are conversing./

/Motilal (Deshabandhu's great admirer):/ At long last our beloved Mother India has gained her independence! All her stupendous efforts have finally been crowned with success!

/Deshabandhu:/ Yes, I have heard that breathtaking news, my dear friend, and also I have heard that your son, Jawaharlal, has become our Prime Minister. I am so happy that he has emerged as a star of unparalleled brilliance in the firmament of India.

/Motilal:/ This is due to your blessings, Deshabandhu, and the blessings of all those who truly love our Mother India.

/Deshabandhu:/ But alas, dear Motilal, Bengal's fate is excruciating! Our green-gold Bengal has now become a black cremation-ground. Not a single leader has sprung forth from her sacred heart to bear the responsibility of our Motherland. But, my friend, you can be truly proud of your most illustrious Jawaharlal.

/Motilal:/ Deshabandhu, what about your mind-begotten son, Subhas? Subhas has conquered the heartbeat and life-breath of each and every Indian soul. Without a shadow of doubt, Subhas' place in the chronicle of our Mother India's ageless life is infinitely higher than my son's!

/Deshabandhu:/ Alas, I had so much hope in my Subhas and in the others. One by one, untimely, they left Mother Bengal; they deserted her. They, too, have now come to Heaven without liberating Bengal, and our Mother is helplessly drowning in a sea of tears and blood.

/Enter a certain Vaishnava, like Deshabandhu a devotee of Vishnu/

/Deshabandhu:/ I am so happy that you have come to bless my abode.

/Vaishnava:/ I have come to you for a ticket.

/Deshabandhu:/ What kind of ticket?

/Vaishnava:/ I need a ticket to roam freely in Heaven, on earth, in the infernal region and throughout all planes of consciousness. This is all I need for the time being; afterwards I will need a different ticket from you.

/Motilal:/ May I know your name?

/Vaishnava:/ Certainly! But first tell me, will you give me the ticket? If not, why should I take the trouble of telling you my name? Would you not like to show me that your life's generosity and your heart's magnanimity far surpass Deshabandhu's?

/Motilal:/ What! How dare you compare my insignificant existence with his all-illumining life? Do you not know that I love him and adore him unreservedly? He kindly and compassionately showers his blessingful affection upon me and tells the world that I am his friend. Therefore, I had in mind to make a special request of Deshabandhu on your behalf to grant you the ticket that you need.

/Vaishnava:/ You have to make a request of Deshabandhu? Am I at the right place? Am I standing before the right person? Is this not the abode of Deshabandhu? Perhaps it is not! In that case, I am leaving!

/Motilal:/ Stop, Venerable Vaishnava-stop! This is Deshabandhu himself /(pointing to Deshabandhu)/. Stop! Do not go away! Please, do not go away!

/Vaishnava:/ All right, now I can tell you my name, but in abbreviated form. I am shortening it considerably: One Thousand Eight Sri Tribuban Das Ghana Shyama Sri Krishna Charan Bharasha Prasadananda Das.

/Deshabandhu:/ This is your abridged name? Is it your hard-earned name, or have you inherited such a splendid name?

/Deshabandhu and Motilal burst into wild laughter./

/Vaishnava:/ This is my hard-earned name! /I/ earned it! My parents gave me the name Shibu. Now tell me, what about my ticket?

Enter Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Deshapriya

/Vaishnava:/ What is this nonsense? What is this absurdity? Why are /they/ coming here? Please, please fulfil my desire first, before you speak to them! /(To Subhas and Deshapriya)/ Please, please wait a little! Let Deshabandhu fulfil my desire first by granting me my ticket. I am sure you, too, have come here to ask for something.

/Deshapriya (to Deshabandhu):/ I have brought Subhas here to offer his devoted obeisance to you, Deshabandhu. Ah, I see Nehru here! Pranam, pranam! I bow to you, I salute you!

/Motilal:/ Subhas is here? Our leader is here? /(He stands up and embraces Subhas.)/

/Vaishnava:/ Alas, these friends of yours are ruining my request! I shall be here again tomorrow. (Exit Vaishnava)

/Deshabandhu:/ Subhas, you too have come back? What will our Mother Bengal do now? Like us, you too have deserted Mother Bengal?

/Netaji:/ It is /you,/ Deshabandhu, who can save our Bengal from untold and unspeakable atrocities. Once more Bengal needs your immediate pinnacle-leadership! We implore your express arrival! Once more we shall be your unwavering soldiers. At every moment we shall obey your infallible command lovingly, faithfully and self-givingly.

Deshabandhu: Come, let us go! We shall go first to East Bengal, which they now call East Pakistan. We shall save our Mother Bengal from the ruthless torture of division-night. Come, my Subhas! Come, Jatin! You two remain always with me. If you two are with me, then there is nothing that I will not be able to accomplish for our Mother Bengal.

/With adamantine will, all three hero-souls descend from Heaven to their beloved Bengal./

Pandit-ji, it is so painful.
You took the trouble to visit your friend-rival
Subhas Chandra's shrine in Tokyo, Japan.
Alas, you could find nothing good
To say about him.
Instead you bring the Lord Buddha
Into the picture.
India's first President, Rajendra Prasad,
As well as your own daughter, Indira,
Had such nice things to say about Subhas.
It is simply impossible to understand
How a world figure like you,
How a beloved son of India like yourself,
Could justify your deplorable conduct!

Even regarding Netaji's plane crash and death, Nehru's own public pronouncements contradicted each other. Either Nehru suffered from uncertainty-nights or perhaps he deliberately wished to mould reality-day in his own way!

More than ten years after Netaji's plane crash, Nehru announced at a huge gathering that Netaji was definitely not alive. Later Nehru went to Japan to see Netaji's ashes.

On another occasion, Nehru declared that he was "fully satisfied" that the actual date of Netaji's death was 13 May 1962! Not long after that, Netaji's nephew, Amiya Nath, requested Nehru to order an enquiry into Netaji's death by the Justice of the Supreme Court. Nehru agreed that it was "absolutely necessary to come to a conclusion with regard to the authenticity of Netaji's death."

From where to where! Alas, in 1964 Nehru passed on. God alone knows if Nehru deliberately misrepresented the truth or if he himself was a captive of uncertainty.

We shall not be surprised to discover that Subhas also developed boundless admiration for the great spiritual giant Sri Aurobindo [Arabinda in Bengali], who was also a Bengali. Sri Aurobindo was one of India's foremost revolutionary leaders before he retired to Pondicherry to devote himself to perfecting his spiritual realisation. He felt that he could be of greater service to his country and to the world at large through his prayer and meditation. Subhas tells us that Sri Aurobindo's profound inner message provided a spiritual foundation for his outer life of nation-service:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

"The reconciliation between the One and the Many, between God and the creation, which Ramakrishna and Vivekananda had preached, had indeed impressed me but had not till then succeeded in liberating me from the cobwebs of Maya. In this task of emancipation, Arabinda came as an additional help. He worked out a reconciliation between Spirit and Matter, between God and the creation, on the metaphysical side and supplemented it with a synthesis of the methods of attaining the truth-a synthesis of Yoga, as he called it."

One of Dilip's most poignant entreaties is recalled by him in his classic book Netaji the Man-Reminiscences.

[Dilip to Subhas:] "I want you to fulfil your life following your /swadharma,/ to wit, the deepest call of your nature. Why waste it? Come along with me to Pondicherry."

"I know, Dilip," he retorted. "But I can't turn to Yoga, branded 'defeated' by life." His lips quivered and sparks flew from his eyes.

"But you are not defeated-yet. On the contrary, you are the idol of young Bengal...."

"...If I go with you into even a temporary seclusion, I am afraid I may not be able to come out again into the open with the fire of the fighter in me."

It was Dilip's dream that his dearest friend Subhas would one day accept Yoga and go to the Source, the Goal Ultimate. Then from the Absolute Supreme he wanted Subhas to learn how to execute earth-bound ideas and Heaven-free ideals.

Subhas felt that Mother India's liberation should be his first and foremost goal. He did subscribe to Dilip's view that the highest Goal is God-realisation. But he was neither ready nor willing to have that loftiest Goal as his own, very own, for the time being. He believed that when the Hour of God strikes, the Hour itself will do the needful. Subhas wanted to climb up the life-tree progressively, step-by-step, giving due attention to each successive height.

Dilip was adamant. He did not want his dearest friend's burning God-hunger in the inmost recesses of his heart to remain totally, if not shockingly, dormant. Therefore, time and again, he made soulful attempts to bring to the fore his friend's genuine God-hunger-cries. No, never cleverly, but self-givingly.

In return, Subhas offered his gratitude-heart to Dilip. Something is at once interesting and illumining: whenever he received blessings, concern and goodwill-even indirectly-from Sri Aurobindo, Subhas the heart blossomed into sincerity-appreciation.

Dilip writes /ŕ propos:/

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

"...I had only sent him [Subhas] a flower from Sri Aurobindo as a token of his blessing. Subhas wrote from prison: 'I think that even those who rule out a supra-mental order have to admit the existence and efficacy of what is popularly styled will power. And this power-call it by what name you will-is bound to act, even if the receiver is not open or adequately and consciously receptive. I am grateful to Sri Aurobindo....I have appreciated (I cannot find the proper word!) Sri Aurobindo's action. I shall not say more lest my language become conventional.'"

To my extreme sorrow, I was not blessed by Netaji's physical presence. But I was blessed by his dearest friend Dilip's physical presence many, many times. In my adolescent years, Dilip-da appreciated and encouraged me most lovingly and most affectionately. He read at least 200 of my Bengali poems. Hard to believe, one of my Bengali songs he sang, along with thirty young boys, in front of the Mother of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram.

When I was about 16 years old, in 1948, I wrote an article entitled /Amader Dilip-da./ There I devotedly expressed my deep feelings for those two intimate friends and two most illustrious Sons of Bengal: Subhas and Dilip.

My English teacher, Rani Devi, was all compassion to me. She took that article from me to give to Dilip-da, who was a relative of hers. Dilip-da made a few minor corrections. I treasured his blessingful corrections. Rani-di brought me the following message from Dilip-da:

There was once a great patriot who conquered the heart of everyone in India, specially the Bengalis. He was known as the leader of great leaders. When he was in college, he was a most brilliant student. He had tremendous fondness for spiritual and religious people. Whenever he could be of any help to the poor, the sick or the needy, he would be the first person to go there.

Once, when he was a young man, cholera broke out in Calcutta, and all the rich people left the city. When the epidemic broke out, there was no medical treatment for the poor, so this patriot used to go to the section of town where the very poor lived and treat them.

Now, in that part of town there were many hooligans. Their leader used to threaten him and say, "Do not come to our section and do not bother us. We do not want to see you. You are well-educated and come from a rich family, whereas we are very poor and uneducated. We do not want you here." But although the hooligans did not want him to come and help the poor, he did not care. He said, "Do whatever you want. If you want to kill me, kill me. I have come into the world to help the poor and sickly. I shall continue coming with my money and my food to try to help as much as I can."

One day the only son of the leader of the hooligans was attacked by cholera. So the young man went to his house and started caring for the son, feeding him and giving him medical treatment. The hooligan leader was so moved! He said to the young man, "I threatened you and warned you not to come to this area, and now when my own son is attacked by cholera, you come to help him. You are so brave."

The young man said, "It is not a matter of bravery; it is my necessity. I see God in everybody. When I see somebody is suffering, when I see another human being in need, I feel it is my duty to help him. One must help one's brother when he is in need."

The hooligan chief bowed down to the young man and said, "You are not a human being. You are Divinity incarnate."

This great leader and great patriot, this matchless leader and matchless patriot, was none other than Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. The very mention of his name brings such a divine emotional feeling into the consciousness of India!

I wish to offer my deepest gratitude to the wisdom-flooded authors of the following books on Netaji, which my aspiration-heart eagerly devoured during the writing of this book. I tender my most heartfelt thanks to the members of Netaji's own family, Sarat Chandra Bose and his wife, Bivabati, and Sisir Kumar Bose and his wife, Krishna, who have so faithfully and lovingly preserved Netaji's writings and added their own illumining and revealing insights. Without them and their Netaji Research Bureau, the immortal legacy of Netaji would surely have passed into oblivion.
