  :END:


Altruism is good, but to know what God’s Will is and act accordingly is infinitely better.

  :cite-key: TMN:2
  :END:


If you feel ambivalence towards humanity, I assure you, God will forgive you, humanity’s soul will forgive you, but your own inner oneness-heart, which wants constant divine fulfilment on earth, will not forgive you.

  :cite-key: TMN:3
  :END:


It seems that we are in an absurd situation: on the one hand, we desperately try to ameliorate our life of aspiration; on the other hand, we cherish our teeming doubts and our darkening frustrations.



* 4.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: aphorism
  :cite-key: TMN:4
  :END:


If you are amenable to the reasoning mind, then your life will be a fruitless, continuous start; but if you are amenable to the aspiring heart, then yours will be the life of immediate start, immediate progress, immediate finish and immediate satisfaction.

  :cite-key: TMN:5
  :END:

* 8.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: aphorism
  :cite-key: TMN:8
  :END:


As God’s unconditional Compassion permeates humanity’s entire being, even so, humanity’s gratitude-heart can permeate God’s entire Creation.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: aphorism
  :cite-key: TMN:9
  :END:


The study of etymology will undoubtedly make you a learned and great man. But if you know how to climb up the aspiration-tree in the inner world, then you become a wise man, which is infinitely more important than to become a learned man or a great man.



* 10.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: aphorism
  :cite-key: TMN:10
  :END:


A prevaricator is he who not only exploits God’s Transcendental Truth, but also squanders God’s Universal Bliss.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: aphorism
  :cite-key: TMN:11
  :END:


A nefarious person is he who has destroyed his heart’s beauty long before he has made his nefarious attempt to destroy God’s Reality-Beauty in others.

  :cite-key: TMN:12
  :END:


If you are spontaneously gregarious, that means you have already taken a long stride to see the heart of oneness on the face of multiplicity.

  :cite-key: TMN:13
  :END:


A simple and sincere seeker finds it extremely difficult to mix with either the intelligentsia or stark fools.

When there is a fight between impurity and purity, humility’s role as the intercessor is of tremendous importance.

  :genre: aphorism
  :cite-key: TMN:15
  :END:


An intransigent person can never have peace of mind.

* 21.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: aphorism
  :cite-key: TMN:21
  :END:


The human way is bound to remain stereotyped, unless the divine way liberates the human way. The human way is to catch the Reality and smile at the Reality. The divine way is to feel the Reality as one’s very own and to dance with the Reality in eternal oneness.



* 22.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: aphorism
  :cite-key: TMN:22
  :END:


A stilted life casts a slur on humanity’s inner progress and divinity’s pride inside human beings.



* 23.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: aphorism
  :cite-key: TMN:23

  :cite-key: TMN:26
  :END:


The maudlin sentiments of humanity are the cause of the world’s downfall in Reality’s oneness-height.



* 27.

  :PROPERTIES:

  :cite-key: TMN:34

  :genre: aphorism
  :cite-key: TMN:42

/From December 1976 to June 1977 Sri Chinmoy offered a series of aphorisms at his weekly prayer and meditation sessions at the United Nations. This series was entitled “To-morrow’s Noon.” These aphorisms highlight Sri Chinmoy’s love of the English language. They were originally published serially in Meditation at the United Nations (the Monthly Bulletin of the Meditation Group)./
