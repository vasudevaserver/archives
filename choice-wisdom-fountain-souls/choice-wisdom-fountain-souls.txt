Anonymous

What is the thing that we give in order to make a life? A constant feeling of oneness with each and every human being. This constant feeling of oneness can truly make a life that will satisfy not only one individual or a few individuals, but the entire humanity.

The hotheads have played their role. They are on the verge of destroying the world. It is high time for the warm hearts to come to the fore to save the world, illumine the world and fulfil God's Dream in His creation.

Others create it."

When I was a boy, I was told that everybody has the capacity to realise God. Now I wish to add that this truth is more real than any other truth created by God and, at the same time, this truth is more devastating than any other truth manufactured by man's mind-factory.

This statement is absolutely true. Here and now, anybody-no matter how old he is-can have the happiest childhood, provided he does not drag along his past and he does not invite the uncertain future. He has to depend entirely on the newness of his hope and the fulness of his promise to himself. Then he can easily have a happy childhood once more.

"If there is a God, we must see Him; if there is a soul, we must feel it. Otherwise, it is better to be an atheist than to be a hypocrite."

Swami Vivekananda

#+END_QUOTE


God has to be seen face to face. God has to be spoken with person to person. We must believe first. Then we must feel and live the reality that we believe in. If we do not believe in the reality within and consciously try to manifest it in our outer life, then we are not only fooling ourselves and others, but also lowering humanity's God-inheritance-prestige.
