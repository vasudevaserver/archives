THEY NEVER GET TIRED

My feet never get tired
No matter how many miles I walk.

But my mind always gets tired
The moment it tries to chase away
A fraction of a doubt.

To the inner Pilot.

Then you do not have to
Arrange, control and conquer
Your thoughts.

TWO MOST DEPLORABLE MISTAKES

You achieved your God-realisation
Far too soon;
Therefore, it was not as mature
As it could have been.
You started your God-manifestation

Therefore, you are encountering
Too many uncompromising,
Undivine and hostile forces.
So you see, you have not made one,
But two most deplorable mistakes
In this life.
