* 66. Forgiveness

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: FHGF:66
  :END:


My Lord's Name is Forgiveness. My name is hope.

To forgive the outer world I need peace. To forgive the inner world I need perfection.

Forgiveness is the seeker's immeasurable accomplishment in both the world of self-giving and the world of God-becoming.

Forgiveness is man's happiness-house. Forgiveness is God's Oneness-Home.

If you are deplorably weak, then you will sleeplessly remember, strongly harbour and ceaselessly suffer. If you are soulfully brave, then you will immediately forgive, completely forget and unimaginably prosper.

Forget the injustice-world. Forgiveness-joy will be all yours.

Cry for the world. Look, forgiveness-light is within your easy reach. Smile at the world. Look, forgiveness-delight is preceding you and following you.

Forgive the world. The world will sit at your compassion-feet. Forgive yourself. God will be dancing inside your meditation-heart.



* 67. Faithfulness

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: FHGF:67
  :END:


Faithfulness means, "I am unconditionally for God."

Faithfulness is man's divine soulfulness, which completely satisfies God.

Faithfulness is the inner fulness which does not need any outer help.

Faithfulness is God-satisfaction in man and man-perfection in God.

Faithfulness is the sunlit path. It most amazingly expedites our Heavenward journey.

Because of faithfulness there can be no ultimate failure here on earth, there in Heaven. This is the discovery, the infallible discovery, made by faithful seekers and soulful God-lovers.

God does not fail anybody. This is the most outstanding discovery of a faithful truth-seeker.

Faithfulness is ruthlessly challenged by difficulty. Faithfulness is unreservedly supported by necessity.

Faithfulness always succeeds and proceeds.

Faithfulness shines in our heart's aspiration-cry. Faithfulness shines in our life's dedication-smile.

Today faithfulness is my victory's goal. Tomorrow faithfulness shall be my self-giving role in man's heart, which will grow into the very image of God.



* 68. Purity

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: FHGF:68
  :END:


A purity-heart is never empty.

A purity-heart does not worry. It does not hurry either. A purity-heart devotedly waits, soulfully watches and unmistakably acts.

Conviction's treasure-home: a purity-heart.

A purity-heart houses a very large amount of capacity. Therefore, it surmounts most of the difficulty-barriers in human life.

Purity is the life's achievement. Joy is the heart's commitment.

Purity's absence is the fast beginning of life's real bankruptcy.

Purity most rapidly increases in the seeker's inner obedience-life.

Rich in purity means rich in divinity. Rich in divinity means rich in perfection. Rich in perfection means rich in God-satisfaction.

A pure God-lover carries the crying earth up to Heaven in the morning and brings the smiling Heaven down to earth in the evening.



* 69. Time

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: FHGF:69
  :END:


Who has time? God. God has time to love me.

Who has time? I. I have time to perfect myself.

Time is the colleague of happiness and the fever of laziness.

The laziness in man usually hates the promptness of time. The divine in man sleeplessly loves the readiness, steadiness and promptness of time.

My failure-life is not the fault of my lack of time. My failure-life is the fault of my mind's lack of awareness, my heart's lack of wakefulness and my life's lack of soulfulness.

Every day time sings for me only one song- the same song-"pull and push." Time inspires me to pull Heaven down gently and push earth up powerfully.

While doing a little thing I smile at time. While doing a great thing I cry for time. While doing the right thing I love the unconditional arrival of time.

The heart of time embodies ceaseless industry. The eye of time reveals soundless eloquence.

Time touches the God-lover in me to inspire my slow body, my weak vital, my unconscious mind and my uncertain heart all at once.



* 70. Pride

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: FHGF:70
  :END:


Some people are overqualified. Therefore, God cannot appoint them.

Pride can befriend only those who are short in their inner heights and inner depths.

A man of pride is an "I" specialist. A man of humility is an "I" perfectionist.

Preference and indifference are the obverse and reverse of the pride-coin.

You are admiring yourself to such an extent that you have made it clear that you do not need even God's Admiration.

You are full of yourself. Poor God sincerely tells the whole world that His Heart is too small for you.

Your excessive love of yourself destroys you not only beyond your realisation but also far beyond your imagination.

Your body is proud of its simplicity. Your vital is proud of its vitality. Your mind is proud of its majesty. Your heart is proud of its humility. Your soul is proud of its luminosity. And finally, your God is proud of His unity in multiplicity.



* 71. Humility

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: FHGF:71
  :END:


A humility-man is a God-satisfying life.

God forgot my name because I was disproportionately proud. God gave me not only His Name but also His God-capacities because I was sincerely humble.

A humble seeker-soul accepts both God's Compassion-Height and Justice-Light equally, happily, soulfully and unconditionally.

Humility-foundation holds the realisation-palace.

Excessive humility is impressive unreality and compulsive insincerity.
When you pray to God for humility, God grants you humility plus His own Appreciation-Heart.

Pride left him hurriedly and helplessly the day he realised God.

Humility has been living permanently with him and in him since the day he came to know that what he has is a tiny ant-capacity.

Because of my sincere incapacity, humility and its closest friend, divinity, have become my intimate friends.



* 72. Generosity

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: FHGF:72
  :END:


My generosity is not self-aggrandisement. My generosity is my Lord's God-contentment.

My generosity is not an unavoidable responsibility. My generosity is an invaluable opportunity.

Generosity is the willing heart's capacity which conquers the unwilling mind's incapacity.

Generosity is at once man's loving promise to God and God's saving promise to man.

Generosity smilingly consumes selfishness-fire.

Only a generous heart does not rob or exploit the poverty-stricken humanity.

Some people trust God because they think that God can and will eventually grant them salvation. But they are not generous in trusting God with their wallets and pocketbooks, for they think that God may distribute the contents of their wallets and pocketbooks lavishly and unscrupulously!

Generosity is from the descending God, for the ascending man.

Generosity comes from the present God-Tree to the future God-Leaves.

A generous soul gives to mankind what he has and gets from God what He Himself is.
Generosity increases human capacity, strengthens divine Unity and satisfies the supreme Reality.



* 73. Worship

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: discourse
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: FHGF:73
  :END:


Worship is God-reaching aspiration within, God-manifesting devotion without.

The human in us secretly expects the worship of patronage-fulness. The divine in us sincerely waits for the right moment to expect fellowship-oneness.

Worship man. Imperfection-frustration will chase you. Worship God. Opposition-destruction will surrender to you.

We worship. Unconsciously we worship fear-torture. Consciously we worship courage-rapture.

We worship. Unconsciously we worship jealousy-seed. Consciously we worship friendliness-fruit.

We worship. Unconsciously we worship doubt-kingdom. Consciously we worship faith-freedom.

We worship. Unconsciously we worship ignorance-night around us. Consciously we worship wisdom-light within us.
