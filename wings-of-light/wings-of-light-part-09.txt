IN YOUR DAILY LIFE

Where is your temple?
Is it not in your daily life?

Where is your shrine?
Is it not in your daily life?

Where is your duty?
Is it not in your daily life?

Where is your God?
Is He not in your daily life?

Who is God?
He who sings the songs
Of self-transcendence
At each hush-gap.

THE OTHER DAY, THE OTHER NIGHT

I played with Eternity the other day.
Neither Eternity nor I won the game,
Neither Eternity nor I lost the game.

I sang with Infinity the other night.
Indeed, we two are the singers
Of the transcendental Heights.

I danced with Immortality the other day.
At the end we bartered our lives.

I walked with God the other night.
When He felt tired, I carried Him along
On my shoulders.
When I felt tired, He carried me along
Inside His Heart.
