#+BEGIN_VERSE

TOMORROW

Tomorrow I shall get up
Early in the morning,
Since today I am dead-tired.

Tomorrow I shall meditate on God,
Since today my impure vital, jealous mind
And insecure heart
Are bothering me far beyond my
tolerance-might.

Tomorrow I shall definitely love God,
Since today I feel a kind of inner obligation
To please my body, vital, mind and heart.

After all, they comprise my own poor little life.
But tomorrow without fail
I shall love God.

YOU HAVE TO PROVE

You have to prove
That you are sincere.
You have to prove
That you are pure.
You have to prove
That you are real.

How can you prove
That you are sincere?
Just see everything rightly,
Feel everything timely,
And say everything soulfully.

How can you prove
That you are pure?
Just feel that your inner purity's beauty
And your soul's immortal duty
Are inseparable friends.

How can you prove
That you are real?
Just tell yourself today, tomorrow and every day
That you are of God alone
And you are for God alone.

MY JOURNEY

Alas,
My Heavenward journey
Is quite challenging.

NEEDLESS TO REPEAT

In my family
There are only three members:
My father, my mother and I.
Father thinks and says
He is great,
Which he actually is.
Mother feels and says
She is good,
Which she obviously is.
And I just know and declare
I am perfect,
Absolutely perfect.
Needless to repeat,
Since everyone knows it.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

FOUR DINNER INVITATIONS

I have received dinner invitations
From God and man,
From Heaven and earth.

Earth will feed me
With earth's food: doubt and fear.

Heaven will feed me
With Heaven's food: faith and courage.

Man will feed me
With man's food: depression and frustration.

God will feed me
With God's Food: Light and Delight.

Doubt and fear will not be able to feed me regularly;
Therefore I don't need them.

Faith and courage may be a bit slow in feeding me,
But I shall gladly wait.

Depression and frustration will poison me
With their food. No harm!
I know perfectly well
That I shall not remain always dead.
For I clearly see that God's Food,
Light and Delight,
Is fast approaching my eternally real hunger.

THEY ARE GOING BACK

My Lord Supreme,
You say that I have made
Tremendous improvements
In various areas of my life.

You say that I am losing
Fast, very fast,
My heart's insect-insecurity,
My mind's elephant-doubt,
My life's uncertainty-dream.

I know You are telling me the Truth,
My Lord Supreme.
But tell me, where are they going
After they have left me?

"Ah, My child, they are going back
Slowly and quietly
To their source: Ignorance."

WHEN I WANTED TO MARRY GOD

When I wanted to marry God
For His occult power,
He insulted me mercilessly
For my stark stupidity.

When I wanted to marry God
For His spiritual power,
He scolded me privately
For my absurd greed.

When I wanted to marry God
To empty my ignorance-night,
He said in public:
"I am more than eager
To marry you."

Divine Lord Supreme,
How is it that You have given me
Trouble after trouble,
An endless series of troubles?

"Child, since you think and feel
That I am the only and real culprit,
Then the best thing is
For you to offer them back to Me.
I shall gladly accept them."

Divine Lord Supreme,
How is it that I smile and smile
And have become a sea of smiles?
Who made me so?
For God's sake, You have to tell me the truth!

"Child, for God's sake,
I am telling you the absolute truth.
Ah, don't you know that your divine smiles
Are the great and unchallenged contributions
Of your devoted heart and surrendered life?"

Lord Supreme,
You have given me
A smart mind, a sweet heart and
A kind-hearted soul.
How can I best use them
In my day-to-day life
And become a perfect instrument of Yours?

"Ah, it is so easy, My son.
Just ask your mind not to see
Ignorance in mankind,
Including yourself.
Just ask your heart to feel
That the hearts of others are unquestionably
As sweet as yours.
Just ask your kind-hearted soul
To show you the real Face
Of the real God."

To you is this:
He can perfectly live his life without you.

REGAIN AND REDISCOVER

You inherited Heaven's property:
Conscious, constant and inseparable oneness
With the Supreme.
Alas, you have lost it.

You now inherit earth's property:
Frustration in depression.
No curse, soon you will lose it, too.

You shall in the process of your fast-evolving fate
Inherit God's property:
Perfection.

Once you achieve Perfection
You will not only regain
Your conscious oneness with the Supreme,
But also you will rediscover and unearth
Your long-buried constant and inseparable oneness
With the Supreme.

A GREAT UNDERSTATEMENT

God, I just thought of You.
Let us resume our old friendship.
Let us not quarrel,
Let us not fight.
After all, we are no longer kids.
After all, once upon a time
We were not only good, but best friends.
And in the hoary past
Not only did we love each other,
But also we made tremendous sacrifices for each other.
So, God, let us resume our old friendship,
Since I cannot brook any further delay.
I am sure Your sufferings, too,
Are unbearable.
"Daughter, I loved and still love
And will always love you
Infinitely more than you have ever loved Me.
Therefore, for you to say my sufferings are unbearable
Is a great understatement."

LORD I NEED YOU MORE

Lord, I need You more than You need me.
I love You more than You love me,
At least on the physical plane,
Or at least that is what my proud discovery is.
So Lord, don't make a fool of Yourself
By cherishing unhealthy thoughts
That I do not care for You at all.
I do care for You, hundreds of times,
But what actually happens is this:
Sometimes my old friends,
Fear, doubt, insecurity and anxiety
Make me feel that they need me
More than I need You.
Therefore, my ever-sympathetic heart
Overflows to them with diamond-concern.
Alas, at that time I forget You,
I don't love You and I even ignore You.
Lord, since I love You and need You
More than You love and need me,
I am bound to return to You
And to You alone, without fail.

While leading God,
If I go astray,

And guide me to my destination.

If he makes a deplorable mistake,
My pure and sympathetic heart
Will want to share half the penalty,
If not more.

Right in front of my Lord's Palace.

Between the compassion-sky
Of my Father-Heaven

Devotedly and soulfully.

I taught my life
Where to speak:
In the garden of Love-light.

I GIVE

I give
My thoughts no voice.
I give
My mind no choice.
I give
My unaspiring life no nest.
I give
My aspiring life no rest.
