#+BEGIN_VERSE

No mind, no form, I only exist;
Now ceased all will and thought;
The final end of Nature's dance,
I am it whom I have sought.


A realm of Bliss bare, ultimate;
Beyond both knower and known;
A rest immense I enjoy at last;
I face the One alone.


I have crossed the secret ways of life,
I have become the Goal.
The Truth immutable is revealed;
I am the way, the God-Soul.


My spirit aware of all the heights,
I am mute in the core of the Sun.
I barter nothing with time and deeds;
My cosmic play is done.

Another day, another day,
My Lord Supreme is far away.


Another day, my heart can be
The all-giving breath of patience-tree.

My soulful world with its crying need.


Another day, I own to hear
God's Voice of Light and feel Him near.


Another day, another day,
My tears shall win His blue-gold Ray.


Another day, another day,
And then, no more my ignorance-clay.


Another day, I'll be God's Love
Within, without, below, above.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

Within, without the cosmos wide am I;
In joyful sweep I loose forth and draw back all.
A birthless deathless Spirit that moves and is still
Ever abides within to hear my call.


I who create on earth my joys and doles
To fulfil my matchless quest in all my play,
I veil my face of truth with golden hues
And see the serpent-night and python-day.


A Consciousness-Bliss I feel in each breath;
I am the self-amorous child of the Sun.
At will I break and build my symbol sheath
And freely enjoy the world's unshadowed fun.

I am a thief; I steal every night.
Each theft of mine kindles a thrill
On the Supreme's all-fulfilling Eye.
What do I steal? His Grace, my meal.


Why do I steal? He compels me so.
Perhaps He finds no other way
To feed my Spirit's hunger stark
With the Nectar of His shadowless Ray.

I know I am an idiot true.
In the growing clouds my hopeful feet,
Hands flung skywards for the blue stars.
My throes no sun, no moon, shall greet.


I had a dream, a real dream:
God would bury Himself to live
In human ignorance hungry and black,
To human death His Soul He'd give.

I feel in all my limbs His boundless Grace;
Within my heart the Truth of life shines white.
The secret heights of God my soul now climbs;
No dole, no sombre pang, no death in my sight.


No mortal days and nights can shake my calm;
A Light above sustains my secret soul.
All doubts with grief are banished from my deeps,
My eyes of light perceive my cherished Goal.


Though in the world, I am above its woe;
I dwell in an ocean of supreme release.
My mind, a core of the One's unmeasured thoughts;
The star-vast welkin hugs my Spirit's peace.


My eternal days are found in speeding time;
I play upon His Flute of rhapsody.
Impossible deeds no more impossible seem;
In birth-chains now shines Immortality.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

A little joy have I of ceaseless joy,
A little day of timeless day.
Yet knows no bound this empty show of mine;
I march along a goalless way.


O Love! A desert within me ever pines.
Do turn it into a song of dawn.
I know not in what hour of evil night
Thou art, my Lord, from me withdrawn.


Life now must reach Thy Breath of Bliss supreme,
Make Thee the one and only Guide.
Thou art the Bridge between my death and birth;
O let my longings in Thee abide.

With a blank sorrow, heavy I am now grown;
Like things eternal, changeless stands my woe.
In vain I try to overcome my foe.
O Lord of Love! Make me more dead than stone.


Thy Grace of silent Smile I never feel;
The forger of evil stamps my nights and days.
His call my sleepless body ever obeys.
My heart I annihilate and try to heal.


The dumb earth-waste now burns a hell to my soul.
I fail to fight with its stupendous doom,
My breath is a slave of that unending gloom.
For Light I pine, but find a tenebrous goal.


Smoke-clouds cover my face of Spirit's fire;
Naked I move in night's ignorance deep and dire.

Having loved the infinite,
The heart of gloom is crying for the bloom

O Life Infinite, give me the eternal hunger,
aspiration-cry.

In the heart of the boundless ocean.
In fire and air Your Life of the Spirit I behold.
O Beauty, O Beauty's Gold,

Lord of the Eternal Breath!


Agelong the vision of Thy Sun
For darkness have I sought.
I know the evils I should shun
And quickly bring to nought.


The earth is deaf and blind, my Lord;
Its true goal it denies.
It hears no voice, no heavenly word
From those who seek the skies.


O yet I feel Thy kingly Grace
With my feeble mortality.
I shall win at last the Noonward Race,
Plunge in the Nectar-Sea.

All I hope to be mine, mine alone.
Alas, my heart is eclipsed
By dark and wild destruction-night.


O Bird of Light, O Bird of Light,
With your glowing and flowing flames
Do enter into my heart once again.
You are calling me to climb up
And fly into the blue.
But how can I?
My heart is in prison,
In the strangled breath of a tiny room.
O Bird of Light, O Bird of Light,
O Bird of Light Supreme.
In me, I pray, keep not an iota of gloom.

From the bondage-sphere
Of an airtight ball.

It is everywhere,
Death's atmosphere,
Shameless and bare.
