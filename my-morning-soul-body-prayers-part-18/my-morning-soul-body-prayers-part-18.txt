/During Sri Chinmoy’s trip to China -— where he visited eight cities between 24 November 2004 and 15 February 2005 —- he would often practise his heavy weightlifting in his hotel room in the small hours of the morning. He concentrated on the seated double-dumbbell lift—beginning with 809 pounds and advancing to 1,006 pounds on 31 December.

At these practice sessions, Sri Chinmoy evolved a pattern of prayers, singing, lifting and meditation. He also included a segment which he called “The Eternal Beginner.” Here he played a song on his blue violin. Many times these songs had been composed by him during his trip.

For the first two weeks, Sri Chinmoy concluded each practice session with a humorous joke. But he later mentioned that he found it hard to come down from his meditative state in order to enter into the sweet, joking consciousness and, after 31 December, he told jokes during the evening functions with his disciples./
