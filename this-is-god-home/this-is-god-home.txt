This is not my home
But
This is God's Home.

Your face is doomed to hide.

Just because
You are an ancient sage
You like to live in a cage.

Just because

Since I do not have the heart
To ridicule you,
You must not have the mouth
To underestimate me.

Although
I know perfectly well that
In the world of imperfection-night
Nobody can transcend
My ignorance-height.
