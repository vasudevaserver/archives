Lo, he has not only departed,
But he is shattered.

HIS LIFE CLOSED THREE TIMES

His life closed three times
Before its final close:

Of the doubt-monster,
Once when he threw himself
Into the flow
Of the insecurity-river.

TRANSFORMATION

Birthless and deathless I was,
And then I was raised above
The throes of birth and the buffets of death.
This was my first transformation.

My third transformation will take place
When the animal in me
Surrenders to the divine in me
And Immortality embraces the divine in me.

INTEGRALITY

My life-tree has four branches:
Sincerity, purity, humility, divinity.

These four branches bring me
The message of integrality
From far Heaven.

When sincerity offers me
The message of life divine,
Purity, humility and divinity together dance.

When purity offers me
The message of self-dedication,
Humility, divinity and sincerity together dance.

When humility offers me
The message of world-illumination,
Divinity, sincerity and purity together dance.

When divinity offers me
The best message of God-perfection
Here on earth, there in Heaven,
Sincerity, purity and humility together dance.

The dance of sincerity, purity, humility and divinity
Is the highest flight of God,
The integral Universal Self.

From this life of mine
Only two more exalted experiences I need,

I need the experience unprecedented
Of seeing two human shoulders
Carrying the burdens of hell-fire,
Earth-water and Heaven-wine.

I need the experience
Of seeing Heaven-Beauty's glorious Transcendence
Fulfilling earth-beauty's splendour-light.

My journey's start was the exaltation
Of God-man in me,
And my journey's close will be the exaltation
Of man-God in the Absolute Supreme.

It is for Your daily and constant use."

When I offered my powerful gratitude to man,
He immediately blurted out,
"You know your deception
Has touched the topmost bough of the earth-tree.
I have given you my silver advice, my golden promise
And my diamond assurance.
Although they were the products
Of the world of fury,
I certainly deserve infinitely more
Living and fulfilling gratitude
Than what you have given me today.
Take it back,
Take it back,
You rogue, you beggar-woman!
From now on my life of compassion
Shall barter nothing
With the bones of a beggar-woman."

And when I plead with the Supreme
To elucidate the signification

To touch the feet of My creation
For its fire-pure transformation.
Yours is the transcendence-goal
Where the comity of souls have discovered
Their only haven."

Too late to surrender.

O body, my body,
Do not cry.
Still it is not
Too late to start.

I STAND STILL

The whole world moves on,
But I stand still.

The whole sky descends,
But I stand still.

The whole earth aspires,
But I stand still.

With my outer stillness,
I see the Feet of God.
With my inner stillness,
I become the Heart of God.

LOVE, DEVOTION AND SURRENDER BIRD

Love is a circling bird,
Devotion is a climbing bird,
Surrender is a transcending bird.

The circling bird protects me,
The climbing bird inspires me,
The transcending bird immortalises me.

WHAT HE NEEDS AND WANTS

In the inner world
What he needs and wants
Is Immensity's rest.

In the outer world
What he needs and wants
Is the sea of pleasure.

In the world of the Supreme
What he needs and wants
Is the Perfection-throne.
