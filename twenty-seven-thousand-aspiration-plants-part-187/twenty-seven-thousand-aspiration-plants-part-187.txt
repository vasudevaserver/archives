To wrong forces,
Then how can we dare to say
That we are helping the world
To become perfect?

My Lord Supreme,
My soul prays to You:
May my five senses
Be totally illumined
So that I can be
A constant, dedicated,
Surrendered servitor to You.

In the disciple
And the disciple's unconditional faith
In the Master
Will be able to inundate
The aspiring world
With peace-joy infinite.

Spirituality is a matter of belief.
You believe that your Master
Has realised God,
And your Master believes
One hundred per cent
That He will be able to make you realise
The Supreme, Absolute, Transcendental,
Beloved Father Supreme.

Our mind was the boss of our life.
Since the mind could not satisfy us,
We accepted the spiritual life
And got a new boss: the heart.
