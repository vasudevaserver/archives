I ask my Lord Supreme, I ask:
What is my task, what is my task?
"My child, try and cry to change thy face
And tell the world My Name is Grace."
Shall I succeed, can I succeed?
"Why not, why not? My Breath shall feed
Your life of love, devotion pure
Victory all-where when surrender sure."

O time and space,

Reality's light.
O Golden Goal,
I need you not.
My Lord has sought
My journey's soul.

Awake, O Mother Ind, awake!
To burn the Spirit's fire

With the flood of nectar-birth
And stop the age-long dance of the snake.

Soul-stirring eyes of gold-delight,
All-where reigning supreme
Our blind secrecy's dream
She seizes with her all-forgiving sight.
Torn now asunder our ego's screen
Under her smile of grace
Blooms quick our surrender's face
She paves the way to a life evergreen.
