1.
My Lord Supreme,
Do You remember the first promise
I made to You?
Unfortunately,
I have totally forgotten it.

But I clearly and perfectly remember it.
Your first and foremost promise
Was to manifest Me in My own Way
At every moment here on earth."

1.
My Lord Supreme,
Why do I limp along the path of impurity
Every day?
"My child,
You limp along the path of impurity
Every day
Because you and your mind
Do not want to study
At the prayer-school,
You and your heart
Do not want to study
At the meditation-college,
You and your life
Do not want to study
At the surrender-university.

Lift the world upward-
