A PERFECT DAUGHTER

No man can ever have a daughter
Who always thinks of her father's height.

No woman can ever have a daughter
Who always thinks of her mother's light.

No world can ever have a daughter
Who always feels its excruciating pangs.

No truth can ever have a daughter
Who always adores its inevitable victory.

LET US TALK ABOUT OURSELVES

O soul, you and I
Have come into the world
To speak of God.
Since nobody
Wants to hear us,
Let us talk
About ourselves.
O soul, I think that
Without God's guidance
I can teach His world.
"O seeker, I think that
I can manifest God
Without your assistance."

The saint was about to fall
When he saw not the Face of God
In the mind of darkness

Of love within, without,
And
When he sang the song
Of life-transforming Light.

To offer me your wise
Advice,
