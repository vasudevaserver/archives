With utterly fruitless failure-pangs.

My Lord Beloved Supreme,
I wanted to be the slave
Of Your Heart.
Perhaps it was presumptuous
On my part.
I changed my mind.
I wanted to be the slave
Of Your Eye.
Perhaps that too was presumptuous
On my part.
I wanted to be the slave
Of Your Feet.
Alas, Your lack of response
Clearly showed me
That it was nothing but audacity
On my part.
Now I want to be the slave
Of the dust of Your Feet.
Even the dust of Your Feet
Does not care for the pangs
Of my heart!
My life is dancing inside
My humiliation-pride-room.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

My Lord Beloved,
I thought You gave me the path
Of sweet, illumining
And fulfilling devotion.
But now I see
That the path You have given me
Is the path of birthless
And deathless frustration.
"My child,
Are you not tired
Of your marathon-complaints?"
My Lord, why?
Why should I be?
If You can enjoy
Your infinite Peace and Bliss
All by Yourself
While torturing me,
My heart,
And even my breath,
Why should I remain silent?
But, my Lord, if You are tired,
Then I can show You
My unsolicited compassion.
And to-morrow,
At our mutual leisure time,
I can drive my complaint-train
And give You
A longer than the longest ride!
