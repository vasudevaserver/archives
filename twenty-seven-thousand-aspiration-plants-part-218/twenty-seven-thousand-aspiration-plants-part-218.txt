There is only one miracle:
A oneness-love-peace-heart.

Love the world,
But do not let the world know
What your plans are
For world-transformation.
If the world knows
What you are going to do,
It will in countless ways
Take away your inspiration-joy.
Without fail, you will not succeed.

How painful it is to see
That each time a God-representative
Comes into the world
To raise the consciousness
Of humanity,
He is not only misunderstood
But also reviled
By those whom he came to liberate
From the meshes of ignorance.
