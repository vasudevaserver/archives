HIS KNOWLEDGE AND HIS UNDERSTANDING

He knows everything.
He knows everything
And understands nothing.

He understands everything.
He understands everything
And knows nothing.

To be in the world of the soul
Is to know everything.
To be in the world of the mind
Is to understand nothing.

To be in the world of the vital
Is to understand everything.
To be in the world of the body
Is to know nothing.

NOBODY'S BUSINESS

Nobody's business
Is everybody's necessity.

Nobody's business
Is everybody's duty.

Nobody's business
Is everybody's depth of realisation.

Nobody's business
Is everybody's sense of universal perfection.

TWO DIFFERENT THINGS

Perfection is another.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

I CAN'T FOLLOW

I can't follow God
Because
He wants, instead, to follow me most faithfully.

I follow man
Because
He wants to lead me constantly.

Staying behind,
God inspires me
To reach my sun-world.

Staying ahead,
Man instigates me
To ignore my aspiration-world.

WHEN I LIVE

When I live in the vital world
I find it easier to break than to build.

When I live in the physical world
I find it easier to sleep than to work.

When I live in the mental world
I find it easier to doubt and suspect
Than to love and embrace.

When I live in the psychic world
I find it easier to build than to break,
I find it easier to work than to sleep,
I find it easier to love and embrace
Than to doubt and suspect.

Unlike in other worlds,
In my psychic world
I want what I need,
I get what I want.

WHEN

When I smile,
I make everything out of nothing.
When I love,
I make everything out of nothing.
When I offer,
I make everything out of nothing.
But
When I hesitate to smile,
I make nothing out of everything.
When I delay in loving,
I make nothing out of everything.
When I calculate in my offering,
I make nothing out of everything.

But waits for the hour to strike.
He knows that at the choice hour
God Himself will open
The door for him
Quietly,
Proudly,
Unconditionally.

TWO CONDUCTORS

Man the conductor
Sees the players
And
Sees not the audience.
His hunger for growing appreciation

Hears the aspiration-music of the cosmic gods
And
Becomes the appreciation-applause of the divine audience.
His hunger for the joy-distribution
Is
Sumptuously fed.

HIS DOUBT AND HIS FAITH

His doubt dares to solve
All his problems

All his problems
Created by his morning doubt-clouds
And
Nourished by his evening doubt-storms.

MACHINE AND MAN

When a machine
Wants to think like a man,
God feels proud of His Dream-Boat.
He starts singing and dancing.

When a man
Wants to think like a machine,
God feels sorry for man's unevolving life.
He buries His Mind and Vital
In the soil of despair-night
And
He drowns His Heart and Soul
In the giant bosom of failure-sea.

Unfathomed,
Sovereign,

TRANSFORMATION

"Everyone thinks of
Changing the world, but no one thinks of
Changing himself."
- /Tolstoy/

I tried to change myself;
I badly failed.

I tried to change the world;
To my wide surprise,
The world had achieved
Its perfection-light long before
I made my surrendered attempt.

I failed to change my life
Because
I mixed too much
With my Master, Ego,
With my Disciple, Doubt.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

BEING AMERICAN MEANS

Mr. Heinrich Boll, West Germany's
1972 Nobel Laureate in literature, declared:
"Being American means the chance to be what you want."

I asked my God two small questions:
What is the meaning of chance?
What do Americans want to be?
"My son, you are a God-lover.
For a God-lover there is no such thing as chance.
My dictionary does not house that particular word.
What you and I call Grace, others call chance.

"My son, here is My answer
To your second question:
Americans want to be perfect slaves to their freedom."
Father, what do You mean?
I don't understand Your answer.
Please be a little more explicit.

"What I mean is this:
Americans are not profitably,
Consciously and unreservedly
Using their freedom-soul
To reach the acme of their Freedom-Goal."

BACK TO MY DESK

Mr. Boll said:
"I am travelling too much and I want to go
Back to my desk."

Since I have the same problem,
Although in an infinitesimal measure,
I sought my God's advice.
God said: "My son, to Me your bed is your perfect desk.
To Me, your car is your perfect desk.
To Me, a jet plane is your perfect desk.

"Inspiration
Is in your heart.
Aspiration
Is in your soul.
Revelation
Is in your eyes.
Manifestation
Is in your hands."

One percent.
Finally I depend on man's conditional assistance,
One half of one percent.
