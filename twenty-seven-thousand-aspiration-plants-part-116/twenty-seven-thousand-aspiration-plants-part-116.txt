For God-Satisfaction,

When you serve God
For God-Satisfaction,
Rest assured that God feels
That His entire creation
Will before long
Be in your vastness-oneness-heart.

Can be torn down
Only with the heart's soulful cries
And the life's powerful smiles.

"My child, I am giving you
The immediate answer:
The day your outer life becomes
A sky-vast surrender
And your inner life becomes
A sea-deep gratitude."
