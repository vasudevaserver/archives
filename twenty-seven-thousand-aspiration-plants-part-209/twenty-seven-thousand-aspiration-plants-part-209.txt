You may say that the soul
Is hard to see,
Harder to feel
And hardest to converse with,
But I tell you,
The soul-reality is the only reality
That will eventually give you
The oneness-fulness-breath
Of Immortality.

So many times
I have deceived you,
But still your faith in me
Is not only beautiful

There is only one real path,
And that path is
The path of the heart.
Walk along that path
If full satisfaction is something
That you want and need.
