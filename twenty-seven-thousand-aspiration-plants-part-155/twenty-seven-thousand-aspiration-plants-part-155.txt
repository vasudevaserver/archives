From time to time
Along life's road,
Restlessness-monkeys do come
To torment us.
But we must pay no attention to them.
We must walk fast, very fast,
Along life's road
To reach our supreme destination:
Nature's perfection.

So it can play the role of a policeman.

To arrest your uncomely thoughts
Immediately.
